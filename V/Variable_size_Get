#`{
Raku's Int type is arbitrary sized, and therefore the abstract size of the
integer depends on how many bits are needed to represent it. While the
internal representation is likely to be "chunky" by 32 or 64 bits, this is
considered an implementation detail and is not revealed to the programmer.
Native types such as int64 or num32 are of fixed size; Raku supports
representational polymorphism of such types (and compositions of such
types) through a pluggable meta-object protocol providing "knowhow" objects
for the various representations. Currently the NativeHOW knowhow may be
interrogated for the bit sizes of native types, but this is officially
outside the purview of the language itself (so far).
