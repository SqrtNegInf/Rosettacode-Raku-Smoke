#`< This is a natural job for hyperoperators, which can vectorize any
operator.  For infix operators the pointy end indicates which side to
"dwim", repeating elements on that side until the other side runs out. In
particular, repeating the key naturally falls out of this cyclic dwimmery,
as does repeating the various constants to be applied with any of several
operations to every element of the list. Factoring out the canonicalization
and decanonicalization lets us see quite clearly that the only difference
between encryption and decryptions is the sign of the vector
addition/subtraction. Since hyperops are inherently parallelizable, this
algorithm might run well in your GPU.
