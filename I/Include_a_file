# Raku provides a module system that is based primarily on importation of symbols rather than
# on inclusion of textual code:

# use MyModule;

# However, one can evaluate code from a file:
# require 'myfile.p6';

# One can even do that at compile time:
# BEGIN require 'myfile.p6'

# None of these are true inclusion, unless the require cheats and modifies the current input string of the parser. To get a true textual inclusion, one could define an unhygienic textual macro like this:

# macro include(AST $file) { slurp $file.eval }
# include('myfile.p6');
