# In a nutshell, picking an element from a list
# is implemented with a method conveniently called "pick":

@res.push: (1, 2, 3).pick;
# There are various ways of doing something similar, though.
# Raku has actually two methods (with associated functional forms)
# to return random elements depending on whether you are doing selection
# with or without replacement.
# Selection with replacement: (roll of a die)

@res.push: (1..6).roll;    # return one random value in the range 1 through 6
@res.push: (1..6).roll(3); # return a list of 3 random values in the range 1 through 6
#(1..6).roll(*); # return a lazy infinite list of random values in the range 1 through 6

# Selection without replacement: (pick a card from a deck)
# define the deck
my @deck = (<2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 J Q K A>) X~ <S C H D>;
@res.push: @deck;
@res.push: @deck.pick;    # Pick a card
@res.push: @deck.pick(5); # Draw 5
@res.push: @deck.pick(*); # Get a shuffled deck

# Or you can always use the normal rand built-in
# to generate a subscript (which automatically truncates any fractional part):

my @array = <1 2 3 3 4 5 6>;
@res.push: @array[@array Ã— rand];

# However, the pick and roll methods (not to be confused
# with the pick-and-roll method in basketball) are more general
# insofar as they may be used on any enumerable type:

@res.push: Bool.pick;  # returns either True or False
