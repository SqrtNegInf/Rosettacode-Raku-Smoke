There isn't anything built-in to do this in Rakudo Perl 6, though it's
pretty easy to cobble something together piggybacking off of the exception
system. It would probably be better to instantiate a specific "DEBUG"
exception to avoid interfering with other user instantiated ad-hoc
exceptions, but for a quick-and-dirty demo, this should suffice.  This
example will report any payload contents passed to the exception. If you
want specific information, it will need to be passed in, though some of it
may be determinable through introspection. Reports the file name and line
number where the "debug" call originated and unwinds the call stack to
trace through the subroutine calls leading up to it. Will follow the call
chain into included files and modules, though calls to the CORE setting and
dispatcher are filtered out here to reduce noise.  Comments with the files
line numbers are added here to make it easier to match up the debug output
with the file. Typically you would be editing the file in an editor that
provides line numbering so that wouldn't be necessary/helpful.
