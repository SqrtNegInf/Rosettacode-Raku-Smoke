# Like Perl 5, Raku is intended to run largely stackless, so all
# allocations are really on the heap, including activation records.
# Allocations are managed automatically. It is easy enough to allocate a
# memory buffer of a particular size however, if you really need it:

my $buffer = Buf.new(0 xx 1024);
