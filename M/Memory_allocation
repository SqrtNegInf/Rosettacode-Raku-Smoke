# Like Perl 5, Perl 6 is intended to run largely stackless, so all allocations are really on the heap, including activation records. Allocations are managed automatically. It is easy enough to allocate a memory buffer of a particular size however, if you really need it:

my $buffer = Buf.new(0 xx 1024);
