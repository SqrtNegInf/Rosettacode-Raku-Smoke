#`{
Using the array @seps in a pattern automatically does alternation.
By default this would do longest-term matching (that is, | semantics), but we can force it to do left-to-right matching by embedding the array in a short-circuit alternation (that is, || semantics).
As it happens, with the task's specified list of separators, it doesn't make any difference.


Perl 6 automatically returns Match objects that will stringify to the matched pattern, but can also be interrogated for their match positions, as illustrated above by post-processing the results two different ways.
