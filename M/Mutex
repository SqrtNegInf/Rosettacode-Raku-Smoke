# Locks are reentrant. You may explicitly lock and unlock them, but the
# syntax above guarantees the lock will be unlocked on scope exit, even if by
# thrown exception or other exotic control flow. That being said, direct use
# of locks is discouraged in Raku in favor of promises, channels, and
# supplies, which offer better composable semantics.
