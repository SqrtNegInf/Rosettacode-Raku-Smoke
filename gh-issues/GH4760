#n# bug source: PWC 148 #2 Bruce Gray, Raku [JVM]
#n# In one special case (superscripts for exponentiation) JVM handles Unicode as one expects, which gets your hopes up, 
#n#   but otherwise silently treats the various kinds of Unicode 'numbers' as zero values, thus dashing them.
#n# See also: GH4291

say 2²;     # 4 - OK
say 2**²;   # 1 - no
say ²;      # 0 - no
say ⅓;      # 0 - no
say 3 * ⅓;  # 0 - no

MoarVM does what you'd expect with all of the above.

This is perhaps more a LTA situation than a straight-ahead bug, and I can live with NYI, but...
Any chance of a warning? "You keep using that number. I do not think it means what you think it means."

Or possibly more practical, something analagous to the compile-time warning you get with non-ASCII variable names
