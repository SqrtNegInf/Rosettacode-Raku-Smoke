#n# bug source: G/Geometric_algebra (plus anything that uses 'Clifford' module)
#n# Welcome to Rakudo™ v2021.12-161-g4365d9b6d Built on MoarVM version 2021.12-81-gf1101b95d.

# source: http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra (whose code is a subset of the 'Clifford' module)
# This highly mangled/golf'ed code segfaults when creating even the simplest possible MultiVector
# Everything works fine when 'UInt' is replaced by 'Int'

unit class MultiVector;
subset UIntHash of MixHash where .keys.all ~~ UInt;
has UIntHash $.blades;

multi method new(UIntHash $blades) returns MultiVector { self.new: :$blades }
multi method new(Str $ where /^^e(\d+)$$/) { self.new: (1 +< (2×$0)    ).MixHash }

MultiVector.new: "e1";
