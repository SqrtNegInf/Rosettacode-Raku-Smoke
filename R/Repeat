#`{
Of course, we could have just written example() xx 3; or even (say rand) xx 3; directly; 
the custom repeat subroutine is just here to satisfy the task description.

Notes on the xx operator:
Unlike other operators, it evaluates its left-hand-side argument lazily - that's why we can simply call f() there rather than passing it as a function object.
The operator has a return value: A list consisting of the return values of the left-hand-side (and building lists is in fact what xx is usually used for).

General notes:
The & sigil in the repeat subroutine signature restricts that parameter to types that implement the Callable role, and makes it available inside the repeat subroutine body as if it were a lexically scoped sub.
The parentheses in the last line are necessary to disambiguate it as a call to our custom subroutine, rather than an attempt to use the built-in repeat { ... } while ... construct.
