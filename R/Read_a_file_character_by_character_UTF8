# Raku has a built in method .getc to get a single character from an open file handle. File handles default to UTF-8, so they will handle multi-byte characters correctly.
# To read a single character at a time from the Standard Input terminal; $*IN in Raku:

#.say while defined $_ = $*IN.getc;

# Or, from a file:
my $filename = 'ref/test.txt';
