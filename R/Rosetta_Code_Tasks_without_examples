100_doors

<p>There are 100 doors in a row that are all initially closed.
</p><p>You make 100 <a href="/wiki/Rosetta_Code:Multiple_passes" title="Rosetta Code:Multiple passes">passes</a> by the doors.
</p><p>The first time through, visit every door and &#160;<i>toggle</i>&#160; the door &#160;(if the door is closed, &#160;open it; &#160; if it is open,&#160; close it).
</p><p>The second time, only visit every 2<sup>nd</sup> door &#160; (door #2, #4, #6, ...), &#160; and toggle it.
</p><p>The third time, visit every 3<sup>rd</sup> door &#160; (door #3, #6, #9, ...), etc, &#160; until you only visit the 100<sup>th</sup> door.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<dl><dt>Task</dt>
<dd></dd></dl>
<p>Answer the question: &#160; what state are the doors in after the last pass? &#160; Which are open, which are closed?
</p><p><br />
<b><a href="/wiki/Rosetta_Code:Extra_credit" title="Rosetta Code:Extra credit">Alternate</a>:</b>
As noted in this page's &#160; <a href="/wiki/Talk:100_doors" title="Talk:100 doors">discussion page</a>, &#160; the only doors that remain open are those whose numbers are perfect squares.
</p><p>Opening only those doors is an &#160; <a href="/wiki/Rosetta_Code:Optimization" title="Rosetta Code:Optimization">optimization</a> &#160; that may also be expressed;
however, as should be obvious, this defeats the intent of comparing implementations across programming languages.
