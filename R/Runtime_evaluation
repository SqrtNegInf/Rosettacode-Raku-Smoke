use MONKEY-SEE-NO-EVAL;

# Any syntactically valid sequence of statements may be run, and the snippet to be run can see its outer lexical scope at the point of the eval:

my ($a, $b) = (-5, 7);
say my $ans = EVAL 'abs($a Ã— $b)';  # => 35

# Unlike in Perl 5, eval in Raku only compiles and executes the string, but does not trap exceptions. You must say try eval to get that behavior (or supply a CATCH block within the text to be evaluated).

use Test;
is $ans, '35';
