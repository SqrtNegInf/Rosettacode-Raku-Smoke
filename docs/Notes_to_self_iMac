'srand' issues again, the usual suspects involved... (wait and see, maybe fixes itself?)
'S/Spelling_of_ordinal_numbers' has a cosmetic glitch on last item, 'Role Mixin'.

2024-02-13
'D/Determine_if_a_string_is_numeric' generates 'DESTROY' errors only on iMac (newer Raku)

2023-12-13
'S/Super-d_numbers-3' failed, a one-off?

2023-12-12
Durn, broke again some days back, and remain so. Will adjust results.

2023-12-02
The power of procrastination, random results back to normal.

2023-12-01
Everything remains busted.

2023-11-29
Like old times, 'srand' issue clobbers 14 tasks.
'Arrays' issue still present too.

2023-11-28
'A/Arrays' is sporadically mis-behaving, 'DESTROY' and Type support problems.

2023-11-20
'run/ebnf-blead.dat' missing?
p.s. Seemed to be a one-off

2023-10-24
'F/File_modification_time' failing on iMac, as of yesterday.

2023-09-27
Again, unlike Ubuntu, '3/Bifid_cipher-srand' is working 100%.

2023-09-24
Unlike Ubuntu, '3/Bifid_cipher-srand' did not fail in overnight run.
p.s. Over multiple runs, the answer varied, failure rate of about 10% (at command line).
p.p.s. At a later time, saw 100% failure, WTF...

2023-09-10
Added '3' directory for examining 'srand' changes. Back-port tasks converted to 'myRNG'.
(since Mac-Pro is static @ Raku 2023.04, iMac/Ubuntu are the target for this experiment)

2023-09-04
Renaming of .pm/.pm6 to .rakumod went fine, git rid of 3 spurious 'errors' so back to zero.

2023-09-02
The differences between Mac-Pro and here for 'run' directory:
    modified:   run/chi-squared.png
    modified:   run/frog-16.png
    modified:   run/rosettacode.1tp
    modified:   run/rosettacopy.1tp

2023-09-01
Downgraded use of Lingua::EN::Sentence to 0.1.4 until packaging issue is resolved.

2023-08-26
RC site having problems, R/Rosetta_Code_* tasks all fail, but just this once.

2023-08-21
All of the R/Rosetta_Code_* tasks now working again.  Partly post-host-migration fixes on RC site, partly testing changes.

2023-08-18
'R/Rosetta_Code_Find_unimplemented_tasks' started working again, other RC-RC tasks still fail.
[but 'R/Rosetta_Code_Count_examples' is almost right, Go/Java swap?]

2023-08-17
'F/Fork' stalled today.

2023-08-13
'P/Parse_EBNF' failing on moar-blead (iMac/Ubuntu), just a change in the error message, no big deal,
but now need to have specific versions of parse results for moar-blead vs older releases.

2023-07-30
Tasks where <use lib 'lib'> appears get the annoying new warning. Seems like it will go away only if all .pm are converted.

2023-07-29
Warnings about .pm suffix on modules, a new deprecation.

2023-07-19
'zef' wasn't building, but deleting '~/.rakubrew/repos/zef/.precomp' solved the issue.

2023-07-06
Blistering barnacles, what is it with 'T/The_sieve_of_Sundaram'?
At least 'M/Metered_concurrency' is back on track.
RC had network issues, or something?  Hopefully one-off errors.

2023-06-29
Relaxed testing limits on 'M/Metered_concurrency', but now failed with exception, type error.
(but runs fine in terminal)

2023-06-28
'T/The_sieve_of_Sundaram' fine today.
'M/Metered_concurrency' failed for the last two days (iMac, but not on Linux)

2023-06-25
'T/The_sieve_of_Sundaram' worked for a few days, but hung today.

2023-06-22
'T/The_sieve_of_Sundaram' *still* hung, despite code change. Durn it.

2023-06-21
'T/The_sieve_of_Sundaram' hung, why?

2023-06-15
Smoke-testing ran fine, but 'srand drift' AGAIN, grrrr.

2023-06-14
Trying to test with 'bin/rc-moar-parallel', no reason it shoulnd't work... (famous last words)

2023-06-13
'srand drift' strikes again, 6 tasks updated.

2023-06-06
Tasks run first in smoke-testing (in the '0' directory) have wildly varying 'real' timings.

2023-06-03
Now iMac will test moar-blead.

2023-06-02
Nuke/new 'rakubrew', total 'zef' module re-install, could be some hiccups in testing tonight.

2023-05-30
Two errors at once, what's that about?  [p.s. Both were one-offs]
M/Multiton
M/Metered_concurrency

2023-05-15
'R/Rendezvous' gave varying output, one-off?

2023-04-16
'D/Dining_philosophers' failed today.

2023-03-10
As with Ubuntu, under simulated high system load, 'D/Dining_philosophers' fails sometimes.

2023-03-07
'M/Merge_and_aggregate_datasets': '//*' mis-interpreted by old release (2023.02).

2023-03-06
Bunch of spurious errors, because 'broken' tasks accidentally allowed to run.

2023-03-05
Removed stray switch to moar-blead in 'rc-moar-single'. This time for sure, testing right version...

2023-03-02
Grr, no.  Remove 'moar-blead' so Go-MoarVM-i cannot switch to it.

2023-03-01
And today's errors just about running the wrong version of Raku, tomorrow it's all be fine!

2023-02-28
Yesterday's errors due to out-of-date modules, add 'Zef-Upgrade' to daily run.

2023-02-22
Steps to take to update to latest release (moar-2023.02):
    rakubrew mode shim
    rakubrew build moar-2023.02; rakubrew switch moar-2023.02; rakubrew build zef; rakubrew rehash
    Zef-install-all-iMac > out.zef 2> err.zef
    (cd ~/source; zef --force-install --/test install ./raku-primesieve)
    rakubrew mode env

For 'env' mode, update:
    (cd /usr/local/bin; rm raku; ln -s ~/.rakubrew/versions/moar-2023.02/install/bin/raku .)

2023-02-06
'Gumbo' does work fine here, prep with:
    sudo port install gumbo-parser; zef install Gumbo

2023-01-30
'V/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher_Cryptanalysis' failed, 'P/Pick_random_element' flapping?

2023-01-27
Back down to zero errors. [oops, spoke too soon: P/Pick_random_element goofed again]

2023-01-21
What's broken in '2022.12', some can definitely be moved to myRNG
    Factorial_base_numbers_indexing_permutations_of_a_collection
    Knuth%27s_algorithm_S-2
    Latin_Squares_in_reduced_form_Randomizing_using_Jacobson_and_Matthews_Technique
    Order_two_numerical_lists
    Penney%27s_game
    Pick_random_element
    RPG_Attributes_Generator

What's also broken in 'moar-blead':
    Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm
    Exponentiation_with_infix_operators_in_or_operating_on_the_base [known bug, Unicode symbol in EVAL]

2023-01-20
Settle on testing moar-2022.12, and move forward with new releases as they show up.
'moar-blead' has Math::Primesive now.
The first set of results today are from the current moar-blead, all failures due to
either missing Math::Primesive or varying 'srand' results. But basically good.

2023-01-08
Odd: Raku not being updated currently, but output from 'P/Pick_random_element' changed, never has before.

2023-01-05
Tasks are tagged with <die 'BROKEN on (Mac-Pro|iMac)> to stop repetitive listing of known issues.

2023-01-04
Ran 'rc-moar-parallel' as a test, mostly OK but some tasks differed:
    Rendezvous
    Voronoi_diagram
    Word_search
    Word_search_exp

2022-12-30
Revert to rakubrew v30, Raku 2022.12-1.

2022-12-29
Preview how hard it will be to move to new blead... (NB: review existing notes in '~/_new_iMac/iMac-setup')
Not a good start, blead won't build (see 'tmp/err.moar-blead'); use moar-HEAD-HEAD-HEAD for testing
https://github.com/CurtTilmes/raku-primesieve/issues/7 -- 'libprimesieve' now to '11'
Update 'bin/Zef-install-all-iMac': add back MagickWand and Cairo, amend with 'myRNG'

2022-12-18
Had to 'force-install' Lingua::EN::Sentence module to get latest API, why?

2022-12-15
Keep 'lib' files in sync while ignoring some as appropriate:
    rsync --exclude=lib/.precomp -avC mpro:$PWD/lib .

2022-11-25
'C/Changeable_words' fails 5x more often on iMac!?

2022-11-24
Do tasks with 'unsafe' hyper/race code fail more/less often than on MacPro?

2022-11-17
RC site iffy today, so 'R/Rosetta_Code*' tasks and 'W/Web_scraping' failed, just one-off.

2022-11-06
Yesterday 'C/Changeable_words' is duplicating entry {draft/craft}sperson, related to 'hyper' most likely.

2022-11-05
Both iMac and` MacPro saw failures for 'F/Forest_fire' and 'C/Constrained_random_points_on_a_circle-2'.
A sign that it's time to move both off of built-in random.

2022-10-30
Digest::SHA was intially working, but had to be reinstalled with '--force-test'; is it deprecated?
(affected 'T/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm')

2022-10-25
Normal 'srand' issues stable, cross-fingers. 'srand drift' check now part of daily report.

2022-10-22
With build v2022.07-73-gd9059e3fe all the 'srand' failures reverted themselves?

2022-10-19
And then it mostly came back to together, the tea-cup un-broke, except: most 'srand' output changed. 
Leaving me back where I was before, with the Math::Primesieve::iterator issue (a library version problem)

2022-10-18
Oy vay...  Nuked moar-blead, zef installs, restarting from scratch, still seg-faults all over
Does v2022.07-69-g4d43bbf95 release have issues, seeing lots of this error: (unfortunate conincidence if so)
     No such method 'protect' for invocant of type 'NQPArray'

2022-10-17
Those *pem files in 'meta' required for H/HTTPS_Client-authenticated.

2022-10-16
Updated Rosetta_Code* tasks to indicate which work on iMac (but not Mac-Pro) and which fail everywhere.

2022-10-14
Cleared Mac-Pro/iMac code difference, except for Rosetta_Code* tasks.

2022-10-13
Use Go-MoarVM-i and put iMac-specific results in 'meta-i' (and 'bench', but that's not under git)
Need to fix this (directory path and contents, as per yesterday's message):
   bin/rc-task-status:13:chdir "$ENV{HOME}/perl6/Rosetta-Code/meta";

2022-10-12
'task.txt' is basically empty.

2022-10-10
HTTPS_Client-authenticated failed yesterday with an error not seen before:
    Failed to set certificate file

2022-10-09
'B/Bioinformatics_Sequence_mutation' output changed in sync with that on Mac Pro

2022-10-06
Other than noted below, most tasks now run. 'srand' status is the last thing to work on.
To fix the 'loading libcrypto in an unsafe way' warning:
ln -s /opt/local/lib/libssl.dylib /usr/local/lib

2022-10-05
XQuartz/xterm runs fine, but RC tasks complain that no '$DISPLAY environment variable' is defined
rc-ast-dump > ast.out 2> ast.err; fgrep '&infix:<*>' ast/* | perl -npe 's/:.*//' | sort -u > ast.txt

2022-10-04
Bailing on Gtk3 tasks.
Math::GSL not installing.
All tasks with HTTP::UserAgent abort: perl6 is loading libcrypto in an unsafe way

2022-10-03
Geo::Hash won't 'make' the needed library, so can't install.
Putting more extensive notes on the setup process in with the main iMac migration doc.

2022-10-01
Started work on getting smoke-testing on new iMac/Monterey.
