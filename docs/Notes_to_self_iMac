Ran 'rc-moar-parallel' as a test, mostly OK but some tasks differed:
    Rendezvous
    Voronoi_diagram
    Word_search
    Word_search_exp

Revert to rakubrew v30, Raku 2022.12-1.

Preview how hard it will be to move to new blead... (NB: review existing notes in '~/_new_iMac/iMac-setup')
Not a good start, blead won't build (see 'tmp/err.moar-blead'); use moar-HEAD-HEAD-HEAD for testing
https://github.com/CurtTilmes/raku-primesieve/issues/7 -- 'libprimesieve' now to '11'
Update 'bin/Zef-install-all-iMac': add back MagickWand and Cairo, amend with 'myRNG'

2022-12-18
Had to 'force-install' Lingua::EN::Sentence module to get latest API, why?

2022-12-15
Keep 'lib' files in sync while ignoring some as appropriate:
    rsync --exclude=lib/.precomp -avC mpro:$PWD/lib .

'C/Changeable_words' fails 5x more often on iMac!?

2022-11-24
Do tasks with 'unsafe' hyper/race code fail more/less often than on MacPro?

2022-11-17
RC site iffy today, so 'R/Rosetta_Code*' tasks and 'W/Web_scraping' failed, just one-off.

2022-11-06
Yesterday 'C/Changeable_words' is duplicating entry {draft/craft}sperson, related to 'hyper' most likely.

2022-11-05
Both iMac and` MacPro saw failures for 'F/Forest_fire' and 'C/Constrained_random_points_on_a_circle-2'.
A sign that it's time to move both off of built-in random.

2022-10-30
Digest::SHA was intially working, but had to be reinstalled with '--force-test'; is it deprecated?
(affected 'T/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm')

2022-10-25
Normal 'srand' issues stable, cross-fingers. 'srand drift' check now part of daily report.

2022-10-22
With build v2022.07-73-gd9059e3fe all the 'srand' failures reverted themselves?

2022-10-19
And then it mostly came back to together, the tea-cup un-broke, except: most 'srand' output changed. 
Leaving me back where I was before, with the Math::Primesieve::iterator issue (a library version problem)

2022-10-18
Oy vay...  Nuked moar-blead, zef installs, restarting from scratch, still seg-faults all over
Does v2022.07-69-g4d43bbf95 release have issues, seeing lots of this error: (unfortunate conincidence if so)
     No such method 'protect' for invocant of type 'NQPArray'

2022-10-17
Those *pem files in 'meta' required for H/HTTPS_Client-authenticated.

2022-10-16
Updated Rosetta_Code* tasks to indicate which work on iMac (but not Mac-Pro) and which fail everywhere.

2022-10-14
Cleared Mac-Pro/iMac code difference, except for Rosetta_Code* tasks.

2022-10-13
Use Go-MoarVM-i and put iMac-specific results in 'meta-i' (and 'bench', but that's not under git)
Need to fix this (directory path and contents, as per yesterday's message):
   bin/rc-task-status:13:chdir "$ENV{HOME}/perl6/Rosetta-Code/meta";

2022-10-12
'task.txt' is basically empty.

2022-10-10
HTTPS_Client-authenticated failed yesterday with an error not seen before:
    Failed to set certificate file

2022-10-09
'B/Bioinformatics_Sequence_mutation' output changed in sync with that on Mac Pro

2022-10-06
Other than noted below, most tasks now run. 'srand' status is the last thing to work on.
To fix the 'loading libcrypto in an unsafe way' warning:
ln -s /opt/local/lib/libssl.dylib /usr/local/lib

2022-10-05
XQuartz/xterm runs fine, but RC tasks complain that no '$DISPLAY environment variable' is defined
rc-ast-dump > ast.out 2> ast.err; fgrep '&infix:<*>' ast/* | perl -npe 's/:.*//' | sort -u > ast.txt

2022-10-04
Bailing on Gtk3 tasks.
Math::GSL not installing.
All tasks with HTTP::UserAgent abort: perl6 is loading libcrypto in an unsafe way

2022-10-03
Geo::Hash won't 'make' the needed library, so can't install.
Putting more extensive notes on the setup process in with the main iMac migration doc.

2022-10-01
Started work on getting smoke-testing on new iMac/Monterey.
