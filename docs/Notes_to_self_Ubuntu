Down to zero errors.
For 'S/Statistics_Chi-squared_distribution' must set in .profile:
    XDG_RUNTIME_DIR='/tmp/runtime-osboxes'

Slow but steady, maybe done by tomorrow.

Somewhat fewer errors, piggy-backing off the updates made on iMac.
Begin whittling down the errors, beginning with about 30.

Administrivia:
    mkdir tmp exp run meta-i meta-i/logs ref/test/dir3
    populate .gitignore

'ntheory' performance issues solved with custom Perl 5.36 installed with 'perlbrew'
(problem was with the 'libperl-dev' installed by 'apt')

Inline::Perl5 dependencies require: 
    cpanm ntheory Math::GMP Math::AnyNum Math::Polynomial::Cyclotomic 

Which have pre-requisite libraries:
    sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev

Hard-coded path still sub-optimal in 'C/CRC-32' (but it works).

To get graphing in 'S/Statistics_Chi-squared_distribution':
    sudo apt install libplplot-dev
    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libplplot.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libplplotd.so
    zef install Graphics::PLplot

Starting out with about 50 failed tests. The biggest issue is some (not all) of the Inline::Perl5 
code using 'ntheory' is glacialy slow. These have been blocked from running for now.

Hard-coded paths ('convert', 'compare') replaced with 'qx/which <command>/ or die'
    S/Statistics_Chi-squared_distribution # for example

Start with cloning repository, building Raku, installing modules:
    git clone git://github.com/SqrtNegInf/Rosettacode-Raku-Smoke.git
    rakubrew build moar-blead
    Zef-install-all
