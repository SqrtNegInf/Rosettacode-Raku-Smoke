'ntheory' performance issues solved with custom Perl 5.36 installed with 'perlbrew'

2023-01-23
Starting out with about 50 failed tests. The biggest issue is some (not all) Inline::Perl5 code 
using 'ntheory' which is glacialy slow. These have been blocked from running for now.
Hard-coded paths ('convert', 'compare') replaced with a lookup and 'die' if not found.
