'D/Dining_philosophers' failed today.

2023-05-15
Nightly run hung on 'F/Fibonacci_word'?
Also network down, caused multiple failures.

2023-05-04
VM login keeps dying (or autolog-out?).  Stay logged out, check results less frequently.

2023-04-21
One-off failure with 'C/Call_a_foreign-language_function'?

2023-04-07
'S/Super-d_numbers-3' failed again.

2023-04-03
More 'one-off' errors? (but yesterday's OK now, was a one-off)
Call_a_foreign-language_function
Dining_philosophers

2023-04-02
'S/Super-d_numbers-3' one-off error?

2023-03-13
'C/Call_a_foreign-language_function' one-off error?
p.s. but no more 'D/Dining_philosophers' errors

2023-03-10
On command-line, with simulated system load, 'D/Dining_philosophers' failed about 15% of the time.

2023-03-09
'D/Dining_philosophers', same problem again.

2023-03-08
'D/Dining_philosophers', one-off error?

2023-03-06
Bunch of spurious errors, because 'broken' tasks accidentally allowed to run.

2023-02-27
GUI crashing (but VM doesn't go down)?

2023-02-13
moar-blead updates had stalled, nuke & started fresh.

2023-02-06
'Gumbo' does work fine here, prep with:
    sudo apt install libgumbo-dev; zef install Gumbo

2023-01-29
Down to zero errors.
For 'S/Statistics_Chi-squared_distribution' must set in .profile:
    XDG_RUNTIME_DIR='/tmp/runtime-osboxes'

2023-01-28
Slow but steady, maybe done by tomorrow.

2023-01-27
Somewhat fewer errors, piggy-backing off the updates made on iMac.
Begin whittling down the errors, beginning with about 30.

2023-01-26
Administrivia:
    mkdir tmp exp run meta-i meta-i/logs ref/test/dir3
    populate .gitignore

'ntheory' performance issues solved with custom Perl 5.36 installed with 'perlbrew'
(problem was with the 'libperl-dev' installed by 'apt')

Inline::Perl5 dependencies require: 
    cpanm ntheory Math::GMP Math::AnyNum Math::Polynomial::Cyclotomic 

Which have pre-requisite libraries:
    sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev

Hard-coded path still sub-optimal in 'C/CRC-32' (but it works).

To get graphing in 'S/Statistics_Chi-squared_distribution':
    sudo apt install libplplot-dev
    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libplplot.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libplplotd.so
    zef install Graphics::PLplot

2023-01-24
Starting out with about 50 failed tests. The biggest issue is some (not all) of the Inline::Perl5 
code using 'ntheory' is glacialy slow. These have been blocked from running for now.

Hard-coded paths ('convert', 'compare') replaced with 'qx/which <command>/ or die'
    S/Statistics_Chi-squared_distribution # for example

2023-01-23
Start with cloning repository, building Raku, installing modules:
    git clone git://github.com/SqrtNegInf/Rosettacode-Raku-Smoke.git
    rakubrew build moar-blead
    Zef-install-all
