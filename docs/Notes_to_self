2024-07-06
Skipping 'Shape-Machine' task.

2024-05-14
'S/Super-d_numbers-3' failed, only 2nd time ever.

2024-05-06
No work-around, but fortunately rakudo issue #5561 led to a fix (hopefully, tests run later on iMac)

2024-05-05
Fussing with 'lib/NativeLibs.rakumod' to see if the error that disables Math::Primesieve on moar-blead is easy to work-around.
Use 'L/Long_primes' for testing, add: <use lib 'lib'>

2024-02-14
Raku version isn't changing, but rate of failure for 'H/Heronian_triangles' is up?
Over on the iMac, failed exactly once.

2024-02-13
JVM pretty old, 'jvm-2022.07'.
Is JVM worth updating? Is it even in development any longer?

2024-01-24
Disabled 'M/MAC_Vendor_lookup' on Mac-Pro, fails consistently (old SSL library?)
Modify 'D/Determine_if_a_string_is_numeric' to work on all hosts.

2023-12-17
'F/File_input_output-2' race condition again?

2023-11-14
'H/Heronian_triangles' had malloc / double free (seen once before, 2023-05-30)

2023-10-25
It was a one-off, very odd.  The two other failures today are known flappers...

2023-10-24
'S/Super-d_numbers-3' a one-off failure today?  Never happened before...

2023-10-16
R/Rosetta* tasks *are* fixed, but site is sporadically unavailable, generating errors.

2023-10-11
Fixed R/Rosetta* tasks, failing over on iMac/Ubuntu?

2023-10-02
'Rcmlz' is hyper, not tracking minor changes (in future delay pulling d/l for 2 days or something...)

2023-09-18
'T/The_sieve_of_Sundaram' hung today.

2023-09-16
Safari/'El Capitan' has problem with SSL, solved by switching browser.

2023-09-15
RC site completely down (for me? for everyone?)
Turn off nightly smoke-testing for now, will just generate errors/noise.

2023-09-13
Not tracking further fiddles by Grondilu on the Mandelbrot* task.

2023-09-10
D'oh, have to use different names for tasks put into '3' directory, otherwise results just over-written by A-Z ones.

2023-09-04
Start moving all library files from .pm/.pm6 to .rakumod suffix (becuase of warnings with moar-blead, on iMac/Ubuntu).

2023-09-01
The distribution unpacked 'flat', with Windows-style back-slash directory separators ending up in file names. 
Code works fine after I fixed things up by hand:
cd <blahblahblah>.tar.gz/dist 
mkdir doc; mv doc\\Sentence.rakudoc doc/Sentence.rakudoc
mkpath lib/Lingua/EN; mv lib\\Lingua\\EN\\Sentence.rakumod lib/Lingua/EN/Sentence.rakumod
etc, etc.

2023-08-31
Something goofed up about 'Lingua::EN::Sentence' after it's recent update.

2023-08-30
'rc-get' pulls an out-dated version of 'Mandelbrot_set' from RC?
On iMac the correct version is downloaded...
p.s. Now behaving properly, caching issue or something...
p.p.s. New 'Set' task not pulling correctly, here or iMac, so an on-going problem with caching or whatever...

2023-08-18
Got 'rc-recent' working with better URL (and no .netrc)
For RC-RC tasks, Julia/Python show errors regarding certificate failure/hostname mis-match?

2023-08-17
'rc-recent' no longer working, curl/.netrc provides credentials, but no dice.

2023-08-16
New hosting, that's what's messing things up.

2023-08-03
'Kaprekar_numbers-2' had the 23/24 wobble again. (been over a year since that last happened)

2023-08-01
'F/File_input_output-2' glitched again?
'D/Dining_philosophers' failed today (and has done so recently, but forgot to document)

2023-07-29
Renaming 'Clifford.pm6' to 'Clifford.rakumod' did not have immediate benefits (contrarywise, it broke stuff)

2023-07-17
Working through Perl::Critic gripes, some useful, some will get hidden.

2023-07-09
Yet more changes in 'G/Generate_random_numbers_without_repeating_a_value-2' output. 
Anything to do with v6.e.PREVIEW / <pick(**)> ?

2023-07-07
This is a puzzle, results for 'G/Generate_random_numbers_without_repeating_a_value-2' changed, but
Raku version hasn't (sticking with 2023.04 on Mac-Pro).  How did this happen, why?

2023-07-04
Un-wedged zef / Zef-Upgrade

2023-06-30
'D/Dining_philosophers' failed today.

2023-06-28
Experimental a bit more with 'T/The_sieve_of_Sundaram', avoid endless runs (on iMac, not here)

2023-06-21
Modify 'T/The_sieve_of_Sundaram', in effort to avoid hangs.

2023-06-16
'T/The_sieve_of_Sundaram' hung again. 

2023-06-16
Lots of churn dealing with big 'srand drift' event from yesterday.
'T/The_sieve_of_Sundaram' hung (which I've seen before, on Ubuntu I think)

2023-06-15
Mostly worked, only problem was 'F/File_input_output-2', possibly a race condition? Not on RC in any case.

2023-06-14
Test run with 'rc-moar-parallel' went OK, use by default tomorrow.

2023-06-13
H/Heronian_triangles malloc error: (never seen 'realloc' error before)
    perl6-m(71265,0x700003010000) malloc: *** error for object 0x7ffae4e5b770: pointer being realloc'd was not allocated

2023-06-12
Random library changed to 'JSF64' (in the past week or so).  Implications for 'srand'?

2023-06-05
'D/Dining_philosophers' glitched (but 'H/Heronian_triangles' is back to normal).

2023-06-04
'H/Heronian_triangles' reported 516 (instead of 517) for the first result.

2023-06-03
Roles of Mac-Pro and iMac will switch, stick with 2023.04 on Mac-Pro, moar-blead on iMac.

2023-06-02
Not looking good for continued updates of Raku on MacOS/'El Capitan'...  
Can build a fresh 2023.04, but not 2023.05, so likely no path back to moar-blead.
NB: After nuke/update, double-check that Math::Primesieve gets properly installed (sometimes just needs a 2nd pass...)

2023-06-01
Hmmm, 'rc-ast-dump' did work for 'B/Bernstein_basis_polynomials', so maybe the answer is 'it depends'?
(something like constant-folding or other optimizations make it disappear from the output)

2023-05-31
It's going to be a while before RakuAST is up to the task of doing this on non-trivial programs:
    infix    => RakuAST::Infix.new("*")

2023-05-30
'H/Heronian_triangles' had malloc / double free (never seen this particular error before)

2023-05-29
The QAST pattern 'infix<*>' no longer shows up?  So that trick for flagging '*' as multiplication is defunct.

2023-05-10
'M/Multiplicatively_perfect_numbers' is now on RC, slightly different than 'S/Semiprimes'.

2023-05-02
'D/Dining_philosophers' failed, one-off?

2023-04-17
'srand' changes for tasks using 'v6.e.PREVIEW'?  See if they persist...
p.s. And 'F/Fork' forked up, left multiple copies running endlessly?

2023-04-16
Moved all 'do-not-check' flags off '#!' line, into '#t' line; makes Ubuntu and 'Code-health' happy

2023-04-12
Segmentation fault for 'H/Heronian_triangles' during batch, ran fine by hand.

2023-04-11
Soon to be running on Unbuntu:
    S/Singular_value_decomposition
    S/Strassen%27s_algorithm
Soon to be running on iMac and Unbuntu:
    I/Image_convolution
    M/Median_filter

2023-03-26
Unimplemented tasks on RC, turned out to be trivially easy, just create page with: {{unimpl_Page|Raku}}

2023-03-18
Rescued SEND_+_MORE_=_MONEY* tasks from 'BROKEN OK' purgatory (and added a variant). Keep an eye on that...

2023-03-04
Separate 'Go-MoarVM' drivers for each platform, simpler than trying to unify & add switches.
Continue with adding 'v6.e.PREVIEW' alternate syntax (to expand testing coverage)

2023-03-03
GH5225 definitely fails for me, mysteriously works on M1? [confirmed: hardware/platform bug]

2023-02-28
'E/Earliest_difference_between_prime_gaps' hung in cronjob (killed by hand). Works fine from command line, issue
with 'Math::Primesieve::iterator' maybe? (but 'F/Find_adjacent_primes_which_differ_by_a_square_integer' ran ok)
[p.s. Was just a one-off, can't recall a similar situation. Wait and see...]

2023-02-24
Experiment with --optimize=0|1|2 as a way of avoiding 'srand' troubles.  Maybe will help with 
'K/Knuth%27s_algorithm_S-2', but zero affect on 'A/Average_loop_length', so no magic bullet.
Update 'ReadMe.md' to explain all the churn around this topic.

2023-02-22
Just a little more OEIS fussing...

2023-02-20
A bit of a PITA, but Raku won't manage consistently precomp files, so end-user must.  Of course
my habit of re-building moar-blead in-place daily, or more, probably streses the toolchain.

2023-02-19
AND IT CAME BACK AGAIN... Starts failing right away with 'zef install Repository::Precomp::Cleanup'
When the dust settled, it may be that version v2022.12-1219 got past some sort of bug in code and/or toolchain...
But for reference the step that helped the most (even if not 100%):
    ~/.rakubrew/versions/moar-blead/tools/nuke-precomps.raku

2023-02-18
Wrapped up the OEIS revisions.
'Missing or wrong version of dependency 'gen/moar/BOOTSTRAP/v6c.nqp' keeps coming back, affects 'zef', cannot get anywhere.
This pre-dated the Moar 'bump', so can't blame that (and everything's fine on iMac/Ubuntu).
Nuke/install/merge procedure for moar-blead (takes 2+ hours):
    cd ~; mv .rakubrew rakubrew-prev; curl https://rakubrew.org/install-on-macos.sh | sh
    cd .rakubrew ; rakubrew mode shim; rakubrew build moar-blead > out.moar 2> err.moar  
    rakubrew build zef; cd ~/perl6/Rosetta-Code; bin/Zef-install-all > out.zef 2> err.zef; rakubrew rehash; rehash
    cp -pr ~/rakubrew-prev/versions/*-20* versions; rm -rf ~/rakubrew-prev

2023-02-17
GH5209 fix required only one RC task to change, 'R/Rare_numbers'
Ultimately still had to 'rakubrew nuke moar-blead' as yesterday's fix didn't help PWC tasks that have <use lib '.'>, 
e.g. ~/PWC/{129,130}/2/arne-sommer.raku
p.s. 'cleanup-precomp' doesn't find /perl6/Rosetta-Code/lib/.precomp, maybe that's why PWC tasks croaked?

2023-02-16
To deal with 'Missing or wrong version of dependency 'gen/moar/BOOTSTRAP/v6c.nqp', this worked:
(cd ~/.rakubrew/versions/moar-blead; rm -rf install/share/perl6/core/precomp/*; ./tools/nuke-precomps.raku)

2023-02-14
Same as yesterday...  Spectest was fine, so needs an issue.

2023-02-13
Bunch of stuff broke today:
    Abundant_odd_numbers
    Bell_numbers-3
    Collect_and_sort_square_numbers_in_ascending_order_from_three_lists
    Geohash-2
    Rare_numbers
    Zumkeller_numbers

2023-02-09
Again with D/Distribution_of_0_Digits_in_Factorial_Series: 0.2035/4455110316458 vs 0.2035/517078701653
Trying .hyper instead of .race

2023-02-08
'srand' drift for three tasks: (wait and see if they flip back?) [p.s. they did, but will still replace them with myRNG equivalents]
   Generate_Chess960_starting_position
   Mastermind
   Strip_control_codes_and_extended_characters_from_a_string

2023-02-06
To get 'cleanup-precomp': zef install Repository::Precomp::Cleanup

2023-02-05
More OEIS, make sure they're all running tests.
Careful with 'rc-ast-dump', infinite sequence code tends to trigger generation of never-ending AST.

2023-02-04
Begin systematic merge of OEIS sequences (the interesting ones) from PWC, amending RC as needed

2023-02-02
Remove special-casing around '0'..'9' directories.
Minor clean-up, based on output from:
    pcregrep -L 'STDOUT|are identical|\bok\b' bench/moar/*out

NB: 'C/Calendar_-_for_%22REAL%22_programmers' doesn't contribute to stats (but it works)

2023-02-01
Sync .0 versions of tasks, add warning to all such obsolete tasks, e.g. [0-Z]/*\.[012345]
Anaprimes can flip between three equally 'big' groups < 1000.

2023-01-31
Redistributed code from '0' directory to '1' and '2':
    1 - miscellanous
    2 - OEIS

2023-01-25
'D/Distribution_of_0_Digits_in_Factorial_Series' one-off error? [p.s. appears to be]

2023-01-24
'Null regex' error, see if it persists: ('//' as shortcut for .defined)
    Anagram_generator
    Merge_and_aggregate_datasets

2023-01-22
Testing on Ubuntu brings up a number of issues, to be cleaned up in the coming week.
One that was not my fault: 
    git archive didn't include empty directory 'ref/test/dir3' (needed for testing)

2023-01-21
Testing will proceed as follows:
    Mac-Pro  daily  - moar-blead
    Ubuntu   daily  - moar-blead
    iMac     daily  - latest 'monthly' release (moar-2022.12 currently)
    iMac     ad-hoc - moar-blead (to confirm issues raised by other builds)

2023-01-19
Experiment with using prior versions of 'Clifford' module (so Multiple_regression and Polynomial_regression will run).

2023-01-18
Down to zero errors for the first time in a long, long time.

2023-01-17
'moar-blead' is back!
Clifford issue was due to stealth change in ID: Clifford -> Multivector [confirmed with module author]
But this leaves two tasks broken: Multiple_regression Polynomial_regression ('reversion' method broken)

2023-01-16
'moar-blead' problem due to main/master tooling issues, exposed when Unicode 15 update bumped 
NQP/MoarVM (rakubrew 'issue' reported). Clifford problem stumps.

2023-01-15
After bug fix (GH5156) race vs hyper makes a difference (e.g. 'D/Digit_fifth_powers')
'srand' problems all reverted, a minor miracle.

2023-01-14
'moar-blead' not building, and has not been since the 10th or 11th.
As before 'rakubrew triple' correctly builds 'moar-HEAD-HEAD-HEAD', so use that for now.
'srand' breakage of course, but also: 'use Clifford' is failing, why?

2023-01-13
All broken 'srand' tasks updated, now waiting for more to fail...

2023-01-08
'gsl' from MacPorts still doesn't work with Math::Libgsl::Matrix, so 'S/Singular_value_decomposition' fails.

2023-01-07
In some cases (e.g. 'P/Pick_random_element') using myRNG doesn't make sense, so just update results as needed.

2023-01-06
Got the latest 'Clifford' (6.2.1): zef install https://github.com/grondilu/clifford.git
Tested the 'toodamnslow' tasks (on iMac), they all still work.

2023-01-05
Skipping the 'annual' JVM update, maybe next year...
(but will keep up with one-at-a-time task testing)

2023-01-04
Tasks are tagged with <die 'BROKEN on (Mac-Pro|iMac)> to stop repetitive listing of known issues.
(maket them part of initial 'paragraph' so they end up in 'meta/headers.txt')

2023-01-03
This time the update of libtiff to @4.5.0_0 worked fine (just 'port' updates, 'brew' not involved).

2023-01-02
Sticking new language features (flagged with <use v6.e.PREVIEW>) into random tasks, mostly just to broaden testing.

2023-01-01
For 'W/Word_search*': 'moar-blead' (on Mac-Pro) and 2022.12-1 (on iMac) give different results, unclear why.

2022-12-29
Do not understand the odd calling syntax for 'roundrobin' in '0/24_game_Solve-1', replaced with recently implemented ':slip'.

2022-12-27
Over last two builds batch of 'srand' tasks went bad, then reverted to 'OK'.  Moral of the story: migrate to myRNG.

2022-12-26
Rolling back libtiff to version @4.4.0_0 solved all issue with libgd and all the 'GD' modules.

2022-12-25
My fix merged, rakubrew updated to v32, can return to using moar-blead.

2022-12-24
TIFF library update breaks GD install, need an update from 'brew' now?

2022-12-23
Build v2022.12-813-g02043da92 yields segfaults and compilation errors on many tasks, removing precomp fixes.
'rakubrew' fix is as simple as master->main on line 2666:
   configure => "$PERL5 Configure.pl --backends=moar --gen-moar=main --gen-nqp=main --make-install",

2022-12-22
Bit slow on the uptake here, finally tried this and it worked fine: (solves final issue with 'use lib')
   rakubrew switch jvm-2022.07; cd lib; ./myRNG/install-me.raku
(but this doesn't actually do any precompilation?)

2022-12-21
10 tasks switched back to OK, but migration to 'myRNG' is still the ultimate fix.

2022-12-20
Removed <use lib 'lib'> except for the one case where it's actually needed.

2022-12-19
Lots of clean-up needed with new release, bugs and breakage...
    * grep / excess data bug (GH51XX)
    * some (not all) EVAL's are failing
    * 'srand' tasks failing (of course)
    * module failures sink some tasks (e.g. MD5 / Digest::MD5) 

2022-12-18
As a work-around, 'rakubrew triple' correctly builds 'moar-HEAD-HEAD-HEAD' 
But have to run 'Zef-install-all' again, which leads to:
    * the script hangs waiting for input when installing 'ReadLine' (should do by-hand from now on)
    * 'Digest::SHA' gone (as is plain 'Digest') so update tasks for that
    * 'Digest::HMAC' fails to install, depends on non-existent 'Digest' (in-line the code into 'T/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm')
'rc-non-ascii' giving a segfault? (p.s. grep/excess data bug GHxxxx)

2022-12-17
Trying to update from 'master' branch to 'main'; 'rakubrew' updated, but while rakudo 2022.12 built, now cannot build 'moar-blead':
~/.rakubrew/versions/moar-blead/install/bin/nqp-m version 2022.12-10-gf7e399c47 is outdated, 2022.12-12-gc8a811a00 expected
With the 'main' branch most of the tasks with 'srand' fail, unsurprisingly.

2022-12-16
Install 'myRNG' module to keep 'Perl-sym_check' happy (also means can drop 'use lib')
p.s. But really gummed things up by accidentally putting everything from 'bin' into 'install/share/perl6/site/*' directories

2022-12-15
Yesterday's failures:
M/Markov_chain_text_generator - failure was a one-off, but migrate to new PRNG
C/Constrained_random_points_on_a_circle-2 - new PRNG giving different answer, update testing

2022-12-14
Move PRNG code (work-around for flakey 'srand') into library 'myRNG' (it's just the splitmix64 code from RC task).
p.s. Kludge 'Code-health' to include the specific 'lib' where it resides.

2022-12-13
Those BEGIN's in RIPEMD-160-2 don't seem to be needed?  No failures after many runs...

2022-12-09
π and τ where appropriate (but not 𝑒, gives JVM indigestion), and sporadic upgrade of exponentiation to superscripts

2022-12-07
Stumbled upon clobbered 'Roots_of_a_quadratic_function' on RC site, notified the responsible party.

2022-12-06
Fix just 'K/Knight%27s_tour', to work <terminal cron> X~ <MacPro iMac> ...
.. but then revert, as everything seems to have gone to back to status quo ante
What happened? Wacko optimizer? Who knows!

2022-12-05
Nine 'srand' tasks failed today, but only on MacPro (iMac unchanged).  Raku version unchanged since yesterday...
Leave alone and see if they revert to passing tests?
K-means%2B%2B_clustering
Knight%27s_tour
Markov_chain_text_generator
Percolation_Bond_percolation
Percolation_Mean_cluster_density
Percolation_Site_percolation
Permutations_Rank_of_a_permutation
Random_sentence_from_book
Two_bullet_roulette

2022-12-03
For tasks affected by GH5113, Moar/JVM results now diverge (ever so slightly). Yes, appear to be improvements.

2022-12-02
GH5113 from salortiz - Avoid loss in precision on FatRat --> .Str conversion
Responsible for these failures: (which thereby maybe be improvements?)
Sylvester%27s_sequence
Statistics_Chi-squared_distribution
Safe_addition
Pathological_floating_point_problems
Implicit_type_conversion
Calculating_the_value_of_e

2022-11-29
For 'M/MD5_Implementation*', JVM results used to be the same, what changed?

2022-11-22
Previous note wrong, 'S/Sorensen–Dice_coefficient' has the same feature/bug of non-ASCII hyphen.

2022-11-17
After a real "D'oh" moment, finally got rid of 'Potential difficulties' warnings.

2022-11-16
Ugh, 'Meissel–Mertens_constant' is on RC with non-ASCII 'hyphen', using for both Raku and Perl to match site.
    (only instance in all of the tasks)
'M/Multiton' appears to be failing fairly often, weaken testing to 2-out-of-3.

2022-11-15
No matter home many iterations (within reason) are run, 'C/Compare_sorting_algorithms%27_performance' shows wide
variabilty in timings.  Very loose limits on testing...

2022-11-11
Surpress 'Potential difficulties' warnings (Fibonacci_matrix-exponentiation, Orbital_elements, Polynomial_regression)

2022-11-09
All changes to 'Forest_fire' gone? (code and reference file) Hmmm, redo...
'F/File_modification_time' keeps spazzing out, relax test #1 time limit, that should help

2022-11-06
Additional fiddles, wrapping it up.
One-off failures of 'C/Changeable_words' and 'D/De_Polignac_numbers'.
In yesterday's build changes to random/srand permanently affected two tasks, as noted in *iMac notes (and also many tasks in PWC)

2022-11-05
Lots of fiddling with edge-case testing, trying to improve/document coverage.

2022-11-01
'Prime_decomposition' failed, as sometimes happens.
So did 'F/File_modification_time', looks just to be a one-off?

2022-10-28
'P/Pythagorean_triples' triples failed in batch, but OK at terminal.

2022-10-21
Replace '$^y' with '$^yy' and the vim syntax highlighter works again.

2022-10-18
After seeing Jnthn's comment on GH5074, going to start remove rand/pick/roll from ask task where it's 
just tangential to results.

2022-10-17
Can I get 'P/Pig_the_dice_game_Player' to produce stable output?  Trying harder...

2022-10-15
Nightly compile-integrity test was missing a bunch of tasks (just Raku ones), fixed.
'D/De_Polignac_numbers'failed, with usafe array operations with 'hyper' no doubt the cause.

2022-10-13
For portability, relocate external utilties to $HOME/bin (e.g. from 'bin/Go-MoarVM').

2022-10-12
Changed 'M/Meissel–Mertens_constant' to use an ASCII hyphen, so won't show up in 'task.txt'

2022-10-11
Is 'R/Reflection_Get_source' (test #1) going to change every day?

2022-10-10
Intemittent problems with H/HTTP and H/H/HTTPS_Client-authenticated, but ran OK by end of day.

2022-10-09
No srand 'drift', but 'B/Bioinformatics_Sequence_mutation' results changed since yesterday.

2022-10-06
Meanwhile, back at the iMac ranch... Most Raku tasks running, except:
    X11  - $DISPLAY not defined? (but it is...)
    SDL2 - working on that
    Gtk3 - giving up on this

2022-10-04
'rakubrew build jvm' hung from yesterday, trying a 2nd time worked.  
(but I guess not yet bumped for JVM/Unicode numbers glyph fix)

2022-10-03
'ArrayHash' issue was just me missing something obvious, nm...

2022-10-02
'A/Average_loop_length' started failing in a different way:
Cannot find method 'method_table' on object of type Perl6::Metamodel::ParametricRoleGroupHOW (line 33)
More fiddling, maybe got fix, find out for sure tomorrow.

2022-10-01
New Mac, running Monterey, soon find out if 'srand' issues are the same there...

2022-09-27
Fixed the issue with 'E/Exponentiation_with_infix_operators_in_or_operating_on_the_base'.
The remaining 'Potential difficulties:' only express in batch jobs, not those run from terminal:
F/Fibonacci_matrix-exponentiation
O/Orbital_elements
P/Polynomial_regression

2022-09-26
All 'srand' tasks now updated and working (except maybe for flappers) under Raku release v2022.07-41-g90709d533

2022-09-24
Possibly flagged as in error because of 'Potential difficulties' message in STDERR:
E/Exponentiation_with_infix_operators_in_or_operating_on_the_base
F/Fibonacci_matrix-exponentiation
O/Orbital_elements
P/Polynomial_regression

2022-09-23
Nope, yesterday's problem was actually the cronjob vs terminal issue: The terminal's sequence
starts with 'DGEDGC', the cronjob drops those.  So, among other fixes, restored images suitable for cron-based testing:
    modified:   ref/barnsley-fern.png
    modified:   ref/chaos-game-perl6.png
    modified:   ref/cistercian.moar.svg

2022-09-22
Lucky to notice that 'Average_loop_length' code itself (not just 'srand' output) is broken 
(since build of 20th, 2 days back).  Precisely why having zero testing failures is needed.
p.s. fixed syntax error with assign not bind, but is code actually working?  not sure...

And further: 'srand drift' happened since yesterday, 6 steps, immediately breaking:
ASCII_art_diagram_converter
AVL_tree
Balanced_brackets
Barnsley_fern
Best_shuffle
Bioinformatics_Sequence_mutation
Bioinformatics_Subsequence
Card_shuffles
Chaos_game
Cistercian_numerals
Create_an_HTML_table

But not touching:
100_prisoners
21_Game
Algebraic_data_types
Constrained_random_points_on_a_circle
Create_a_two-dimensional_array_at_runtime
Dutch_national_flag_problem

2022-09-12
'without' used once in tasks, sort of hard to find a good use-case for it.

2022-09-03
'Prime_decomposition' failed again. Living with the flakiness...

2022-08-31
Inline image 'Curve-3-points-perl.svg' for 'C/Curve_that_touches_three_points'. I am hilarious.

2022-08-29
Hacked up a version of 'RC-run.p6' so can expeditously download/test any changes I make on the RC site.
p.s. Which, clearly, I need to do...

2022-08-28
Mol noted on Discord that Reports:Tasks_not_implemented* files are broken for now.
Inline::Perl is back.

2022-08-27
Modern TLS is not supported with 'El Capitan', so have to find work-arounds (curl maybe?)

2022-08-25
All 'Rosetta_Code*' tasks based on wikimedia 'api.php' are broken, have SSL issues on top of URL changes?

2022-08-24
Red-flag day at RC, this will be loads of fun!
'curl' and etc. should pull 'https' pages
404:  https://reports.miraheze.org/Tasks_not_implemented_in_Raku

2022-08-23
Globally replace 'Perl 6' references (about 200 instances, too many to fix on RC)
p.s. All but a very few cases already handled, probably by thundergnat++

2022-08-12
Inline::Perl5 still broken, module author on vacation...

2022-08-03
Bitten by Inline::Perl5 issue, accounts for today's failures.

2022-07-30
Browsing tasks that haven't been touched since the early days of this project.  Some just fine,
some have room for improvement.

2022-07-29
Can declare and push into hash, but other types of assigment require enclosing parens: (my %h)

2022-07-27
Renaming tasks is a pain (macOS filesystem is case-insensitive).
And there's always a forwarding link on RC site...

2022-07-26
'E/Executable_library' is flapping lately; likely has to do with race condition, so took that out. 
The code not too slow anymore.

2022-07-11
Guessing that all the trouble ultimately comes down to a 'subset' definition bug
p.s. reported as GH4980, fixed via GH4981

2022-07-10
'URI' and 'WWW" modules as well. All affected tasks eat memory without bound.  
Also: V/VList runs forever / consumes memory (but does not access network)
Mark all affected tasks with '#t# network' so they can be bulk-disabled when needed.

2022-07-09
Hung on tasks using LWP and HTTP::UserAgent. Been many moons since that last happened. Real PITA though...

2022-07-07
'xdigit' for ':hexdigit': Saw on IRC that it confused someone (plus works with JVM)
Let me guess... Set_puzzle/Spoof_game/Tic-tac-toe reverted to their old output...  (but not Rock-paper-scissors?)

2022-07-05
Built/installed JVM 2022.06 (same old bugs).
Nuked/re-built moar-blead. Here's what happened:
P/Primorial_numbers-1               problems seem to be fixed
A/Autogram_checker                  'zef install Text::Wrap' no longer works? (but works as: use lib 'lib')
S/Spoof_game                        output changed, otherwise fine
S/Set_puzzle                        output changed, otherwise fine
R/Rock-paper-scissors               output changed, otherwise fine
D/Determine_if_a_string_is_numeric  error, but seems like a one-off

2022-07-02
The 'Primorial_numbers-1' segfault persists.

2022-07-01
'M/Menu' OK again? Can't be 100% sure until the batch run... [p.s. it is OK now]
But... 'C/Cyclotomic_Polynomial' hung [but really 'from<Perl5>', so the issue is over there]
And... 'Primorial_numbers-1' had a segfault.

2022-06-29
'M/Menu' hung? Probably just a one-off from 5.36 manipulations.

2022-06-26
Upgraded to perl5.36.0, and this time it worked to just:
zef uninstall Inline::Perl5; zef install Inline::Perl5

2022-06-25
After actually doing some testing, putting concurrent 'Closest-pair_problem' on RC, pretty amazing speed-ups.

2022-06-23
One issue with bailing on 'srand' problems in RC: not tracking further changes, now only seen in PWC.

2022-06-11
'Prime_decomposition' failed again... (but worked when run by hand after)

2022-06-05
New release of Date::Names resolves the issue (Test::META no longer a dependency, perhaps problem was there?)

2022-06-03
What is this error in Date::Names?: No such method 'protect' for invocant of type 'NQPArray'
Specific to this old Mac? Works with moar-blead on Ubuntu...

2022-06-02
Oodles of SEGV again? Nuke again, but hmmm...
p.s. results from this day were lost, so copied from previous day

2022-05-31
Lots of SEGV, try nuking precomp: rm -rf ~/.raku/precomp/*; rm -rf ./lib/.precomp/*

2022-05-23
Upgraded to JVM 2022.04, same bugs

2022-05-22
Eliminated 15 .jvm versions, better as only one source file to manage.

2022-05-19
Adding in JVM versions by getting source for modules, or other simple expedients.

2022-05-14
Learned from PWC: If Math::Matrix gives spurious errors, use 'quietly' to suppress.

2022-05-09
'Median_filter' again, with "Attempt to free unreferenced scalar".

2022-05-06
'R/Rock-paper-scissors' failed yesterday?

2022-05-05
New minor error: 'Median_filter' worked fine, but on Perl side "Attempt to free unreferenced scalar"
A one-off? Neither Raku nor Perl versions have changed lately...

2022-05-03
'srand drift' creeps onward, really time to open an issue...

2022-05-01
The timings on 'Face_sums_with_primes.jvm' are guesses, but it was multiple days of running time...

2022-04-28
Lots of 'oops' today, multiple testing runs to get it finally right...

2022-04-26
Yesterday's issues all cleared up (automagically).

2022-04-25
'Numeric underflow' caught by 'stress.t', so will get fixed.
Lots of churn in tasks today, messy. Revisit tomorrow.
Problem 'rakubrew' shim/env mode switching definitively fixed.

2022-04-24
Brand-new error, 'Numeric underflow' seen in two RC tasks (they share code in common) and a PWC task:
   Ramanujan%27s_constant-1
   0-high-precision-routines
   021/1/ozzy.raku

2022-04-23
OK, 'rakubrew mode shim' is required...  But how to switch back?  Why is this step not reversible?

2022-04-22
Warnings from 'Math::Matrix' went away?  It wasn't updated.

2022-04-21
Daily run failed, with 'perl6-m' not found being proximate cause (even after 'rakubrew rehash'?).
Munged it through by-hand...

2022-04-19
Three more cases of 'srand drift'.
These run fine, but warnings from 'Math::Matrix' generate STDERR, which puts them in the 'bad' column:
   Polynomial_regression
   Orbital_elements
   Fibonacci_matrix-exponentiation

2022-04-18
D'oh, no moar-blead updates for 3 weeks.  Been paying more attention to PWC...

2022-04-13
Belatedly packed away 2021 logs. I keep them because... ???  Never know, might be useful someday.

2022-04-07
'Changeable_words' failed today, not a big deal (race condition related to .hyper probably).

2022-04-01
For Bitcoin* tasks, using 'openssl' to generate digest, instead of module, allows JVM to work more easily.

2022-03-25
IRC logging issues resolved, now collected daily once more.

2022-03-24
'Parse_EBNF' auto-magically fixed... (probably related to 'nqp::iscont' issue)
 
2022-03-21
Cannot assign to a readonly variable or a value
  in method TOP at P/Parse_EBNF line 33
  in regex TOP at P/Parse_EBNF line 15
  in block <unit> at P/Parse_EBNF line 128

2022-03-19
'Prime_decomposition' failed again...

2022-03-17
From terminal this time, 'Vampire_number' worked 
(but 50sec, may have been low priority/ high system load that led to timeout)

2022-03-16
Odd, why do 'Animation' and 'Vampire_number' time-out when run in batch?

2022-03-15
Proc::Async solved AST generation problem, cooking up a run report...

2022-03-14
Memory usage has significantly declined for the most RAM-hungry programs, as per 'rc-memhog' (uses -Msnapper)
'Prime_decomposition' failed again. Should I fix, or just live with the flakiness...

2022-03-04
Re-tested the 'toodamnslow' tasks (overdue I guess, last in 2018).  
Happily, most are faster, and some so much so even got into daily testing.

2022-03-02
For 'Julia_set': Can have concurrency or caching (former is a much bigger win)

2022-03-01
Now a daily report on OEIS citations.

2022-02-28
Yet more cleanup on OEIS notation, in part to allow easier parsing for programatic access
'Prime_decomposition' failed: output dropped the term '2199023255551: 13367 × 164511353'
Removing the 'hyper' is the work-around, but... maybe it fixes itself.
    p.s. It seems to be back to normal...

2022-02-25
Include more tasks in JVM testing, Prime::Factor works (if slowly)

2022-02-24
Just a one-off error on 'raku -c A/Average_loop_length'?
    No such private method 'SET-SELF' on Map 

2022-02-16
srand drift for 'Pig_the_dice_game_Player'

2022-02-15
Not getting JVM installed with 'rakubrew'...
(Moar had precomp issues, but a few 'kill -9' dealt with that)

2022-02-14
Replacing 'rakudobrew' with 'rakubrew', easy peasy, what could possibly wrong?
    GD::Raw module failed to install, but a switch to '--/test' install is a work-around
    'rakudoc': Failed test 'IO::MiddleMan' at t/04-compunit.t line 32
    default for Image::PNG::Portable changed, requiring explicit setting of ':alpha(False)'

2022-02-13
Drifting further and further from RC in capitalization of tasks, oh well.
'Data_Encryption_Standard' intermittently fails unless MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1 [p.s. appears to have resolved]

2022-02-11
Removed 'srand' setting from Sorting* tasks where the exact random content was not important 
for testing (or in some cases where was just a left-over once data had been made constant)

2022-02-10
Undo 'warn on ternary' where it made sense.

2022-02-08
That worked, but all the contention for CPU raises even user/sys usage, tried with fewer processes...  
Even worse. Revert.

2022-02-07
Seeing recent fixes to precompilation paths, test parallel again.

2022-02-04
Found another buggish issue (or at least something LTA) in JVM, will open issue.

2022-02-03
srand drift hit 'Bioinformatics_Sequence_mutation' just a week after output was 'fixed'

2022-02-02
Saints Be Praised, all the Math::Primesieve tasks started working again.

2022-02-01
Initial steps on PWC project (separate repository).

2022-01-31
OEIS citing complete.
Found two bugs in JVM, opened issues.
MoarVM: Many tasks based Math::Primesieve are borked (where pre-compute is attempted)

2022-01-30
Finally done with JVM, did necessary fiddling and clean-up. So much fun. Let's do this again next year...

2022-01-29
Running JVM on all tasks... Sloooooooooooow

2022-01-28
OEIS: The end is in cite. Oof.

2022-01-27
A few more JVM tasks run, but not that many really (given the update interval of a year+). But most are faster, that's nice.

All tasks that use 'Clifford':
sh: line 1: 57467 Segmentation fault: 11  /usr/local/bin/perl6 --ll-exception -c Multiple_regression 2>&1 > /dev/null
sh: line 1: 57720 Segmentation fault: 11  /usr/local/bin/perl6 --ll-exception -c Orbital_elements 2>&1 > /dev/null
sh: line 1: 58128 Segmentation fault: 11  /usr/local/bin/perl6 --ll-exception -c Polynomial_regression 2>&1 > /dev/null

Also getting segfault with 'Geometric_algebra', which fortunately is just a subset of the MultiVector class code, so will
use that for raising a 'Rakudo' issue.

2022-01-26
'srand' drift srikes again, errors from yesterday's run:
   Seven-sided_dice_from_five-sided_dice
   Price_list_behind_API
   Long_stairs
   Generate_random_numbers_without_repeating_a_value-2
   Day_of_the_week_of_Christmas_and_New_Year

Tasks using 'Clifford' (e.g. 'Polynomial_regression') flapping with ternary error?
Updated JVM (been over a year). Dry run for full testing to happen Real Soon Now.

2022-01-25
I see before me nothing but a vast and trackless desert with scattered OEIS citations, bleached white by the sun.
I must collect them, every one...

2022-01-24
Failures from 21st tied to unsigned integers update, will be resolved in due course.
Cleaning up to permit more runnable JVM code.
Slogging onward with OEIS references.

2022-01-23
Continue adding OEIS references, far more missing than I realized (usually in task statement, not code)

2022-01-22
Make it easier to find mentions of OEIS sequences, standardize reference to them, and add when missing
'Average_loop_length' error cleared up?

2022-01-21
A lot of failures yesterday:
   The_ISAAC_Cipher
   Summation_of_primes-2
   Successive_prime_differences-2
   Successive_prime_differences-1
   Strong_and_weak_primes
   Sexy_primes
   Safe_primes_and_unsafe_primes
   Primorial_numbers-2
   Primorial_numbers
   Partition_an_integer_X_into_N_primes
   Multi-base_primes
   MD5_Implementation
   Long_primes
   Largest_difference_between_adjacent_primes-2
   Find_duplicate_files
   Emirp_primes
   Consecutive_Primes_With_Ascending_Or_Descending_Differences

Many reference Math::Primesieve, but not all, e.g.
The_ISAAC_Cipher: p6decontrv expects a QAST::WVal as its first child

In syntax check of 'Average_loop_length' got: No such private method 'SET-SELF' on Map

'Kaprekar_numbers-2' had the 23/24 wobble again.

2022-01-18
Likely srand drift on 'Long_stairs' results, updated again.

2022-01-16
Set up regular ecosystem updates ('zef upgrade')

2022-01-15
Decided ternary problem could not be intentional, was going raise this issue, but thundergnat++ found a round tuit first:
https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/raku?date=2022-01-14

2022-01-10
'Potential dead code' warning on ternary is not going away?
If that's so, then need to update RC.

2022-01-02
'Kaprekar_numbers-2' has a problem with remaining '.hyper'?
'Orbital_elements' spazzed?  Seems to work fine upon further testing...

2021-12-27
Warning for some, not all, ternary?

2021-12-15
2nd time for Abundant_odd_numbers: line 32: A worker in a parallel iteration (hyper or race) ...

2021-12-14
'hyper' in 'Practical_numbers' caused a failure?  Maybe not so rare...
MoarVM oops: MVM_str_hash_lvalue_fetch_nocheck called with a stale hashtable pointer

2021-12-06
'Count_the_coins' now (since when?) works again, as do the Knapsack* tasks.

2021-12-02
'hyper' in 'Practical_numbers' caused a failure?  Very rare...

2021-12-01
'srand' drift for 'Long_stairs', changed output to match

2021-11-28
'DNS_query' hung/failed?
p.s. local network config issues most likely responsible

2021-11-27
'hyper' in 'Prime_decomposition' caused a failure?  Very rare...

2021-11-21
Dang, Clifford again.
p.s. re-install every run, just to avoid what-ever is causing this problem 

2021-11-15
Tasks using Clifford library are hanging ('Orbital_elments', 'Polynomial_regression')
p.s. Fixed with zef --force-install install Clifford

2021-11-12
Precompilation errors are gone, maybe? Parallel testing seems to work OK.
Timing is roughly 1000s longer than for one-at-a-time approach.
Odd, as pretty sure I'm counting CPU secs, not wall-clock secs, and why whould CPU secs go up?

2021-11-10
'srand' variability, these tasks sometimes work, sometomes don't
Rock-paper-scissors

'Practical_numbers' failure just transient?  Failed trying to get another failure...

2021-10-29
Uh oh, variable results in deterministic code. Time for the Bat-signal!
  78 Died at 1804
  11 Died at 1770
  10 Died at 1745
   1 Died at 1895

2021-10-28
Sadly, yesterday's errors persist. Start by debugging 'Count_the_coins'... 

2021-10-27
Novel errors with today's blead, probably transient:
Knapsack_problem_Bounded-1
Knapsack_problem_0_1-1
Count_the_coins

2021-10-24
In yet another attempt to jinx things, note that it's been 4 weeks since tests hung.

2021-10-23
'srand' results shift for just these tasks:
Order_two_numerical_lists
Loops_Nested
Latin_Squares_in_reduced_form_Randomizing_using_Jacobson_and_Matthews_Technique

2021-10-04
Working through new-disp cleanup...
Updated modules. Failed for IO::Socket::Async::SSL, associated Cro.

2021-09-29
'new-disp' release
'Mastermind' needs to be fixed, 'Use of Nil.uc coerced to empty string'
'Julia_set' failing: MVM_str_hash_fetch_nocheck called with a stale hashtable pointer
'Cyclotomic_Polynomial' has issue with Inline::Perl5, module 'Math::Polynomial'
'srand' shift for about 15 others

Heronian_triangles saw huge improvement:
real     13.5  152.4
user     53.3  216.0
sys       3.5  137.5

But 'Unprimeable_numbers' and 'Smarandache_prime-digital_sequence' got slower (about 2x)

Hung on 'HTTPS', and pretty much every task using HTTP::UserAgent

2021-09-17
Hung again, so issue not gone...

2021-09-14
In an attempt to jinx things, note that it's been 4 weeks since tests hung.

2021-09-11
Starting 2021-06-10, sporadic errors of the form:
MoarVM oops: MVM_str_hash_fetch_nocheck called with a stale hashtable pointer

Prior to that date, more generic error message:

2021-06-19
'Mastermind' problem was srand drift.

2021-06-17
'Mastermind' hung again, stopping testing for now.

2021-06-17
'Mastermind' hung.

2021-06-04
New srand issue with 'G/Generate_Chess960_starting_position' results.

2021-06-02
'Consecutive_Primes_With_Ascending_Or_Descending_Differences' stalled today.

2021-05-27
'Perceptron' hung, precomp issues with 'MagickWand'?

2021-05-26
Bye-bye freenode, hello libera; update log collection to use https://logs.liz.nl/

2021-05-24
Digging out from under avalanche of paperwork...

2021-05-13
Many stalled pre-compilation processes, over multiple days?

2021-05-05
Doubling-up of tasks seen again, why?

2021-05-04
'XML_Validation' hung today.

2021-05-04
'cron' jobs all ran simultaneouslly in over-night srand testing?

2021-04-25
'HTTP' and some of the 'Rosetta_Code_*' series hung today

2021-04-24
'Changeable_words' failed today, race condition related to .hyper almost certainly

2021-04-22
Testing glitched while I was away (naturally), been put back to rights.

2021-04-14
chr/trim/int-coercion issues were all resolved

2021-04-11
RC site still flakey, bail on testing while not around to fiddle with it.

2021-04-10
'Nim_Game' fails due to changes to 'trim'.
'First_power_of_2_that_has_leading_decimal_digits_of_12' - not getting good results out of 'Lingua::EN::Numbers'? (issue similar to above?)

2021-04-09
'Barnsley_fern' hung in most runs of 'rc-moar-terminal' in the night (of the 10th).

2021-04-06
'Executable_library' had a memory error, probably a one-off:
perl6-m(72793,0x70000280d000) malloc: *** error for object 0x7fed2153a7b0: pointer being freed was not allocated
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug

2021-04-05
'SOAP' out-of-date protocol? Dropping it from testing for now.
RC site is off-line again, so skipping smoke testing.

2021-04-04
'SOAP' hung today.
'L/Langton%27s_ant' failed, for the first time ever.

2021-04-03
'DNS_query' hung during the over-night 'syntax check' run.
RC site is off-line, so skipping smoke testing.

2021-04-02
'SOAP' hung today.
Over 100 tasks now use primes in one form or another.

2021-04-01
'Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm' probably been unstable the whole month, but by mistake left it out of testing

2021-03-31
Three brand-new failures today: 
Verify_distribution_uniformity_Naive
Probabilistic_choice
Penney%27s_game

New code issue: 'chr' failing on getting 'Rat' type [resolved by adding .floor, a silent improvement via commit 8668474]
Grayscale_image

2021-03-30
'Rock-paper-scissors' definitely in the sometimes-fail category.

2021-03-29
'Statistics_Normal_distribution' failed today.

2021-03-23
Continuing administrivia: finding tasks incorrectly marked bad/missing, bumping up task count to true value

2021-03-20
'Fibonacci_matrix-exponentiation' hung on precomp.
Race condition in testing of 'Arithmetic_Rational', resolved.

2021-03-17
HTTPS hung up, but still terminated normally after stalled precomp. process killed.

2021-03-15
And today 'Rock-paper-scissors' is OK again. Huh.

2021-03-14
'Rock-paper-scissors' began to fail. 
'Average_loop_length' failed in a new manner (run #2 was 2.00%) not seen before.

2021-03-08
'Julia_set' aborted in daily test? Ran fine by-hand afterwards.

2021-03-06
Problem with 'Monads_List_monad' reveals a old/new bug, see gh-issues, would be great if a fix helped 'Brace_expansion' too.

2020-03-05
Work-around for 'Monads_List_monad' issue found, but unclear what changed with prefix/postfix 'join' just now (context?)
Some progress on 'Brace_expansion'

Arithmetic_Rational uses .hyper, but swapped two lines out-of-order; seen this before (2020-04-22) but failed to see cause of error.
See 'bench/2021-03-05-m/Arithmetic_Rational.out' where lines 8 and 9 are reversed.

2021-03-04
Today 'Monads_List_monad' output borked.  Like yesterday, has to do with newlines (here, too many)

2021-03-03
Fixed all issues with 'srand' that I could, now watch for a month to see how the failures develop.
Separately, 'Brace_expansion' task started failing today

2021-03-02
Cannot get stable output for numerous tasks, see: bin/rc-moar-srand

2021-02-20
Errors with 'NQPHLL.nqp' (see below). Have to go back to this: 'rm -rf ~/.raku/precomp'

2021-02-14
Now try both parallel testing and leaving precomp files in place.  Joy or no joy?
No joy, but only 'Make_directory_path' failed? Weird...  Revert to 'rc-moar-single' for now

2021-02-12
Trying in-parallel testing again, since precomp issues seem to have gone away.

2021-02-06
What's with stuff just working? I could get used to this...

2021-02-01
Tasks (Long_primes, Emirp_primes, etc) using Math::Primesieve hanging during syntax check.

2021-01-26
Upgraded to perl5.32.1, again need to install Inline::Perl5 directly from git archive:
(zef uninstall Inline::Perl5; cd $HOME/perl6/Inline-Perl5; git pull; make install)
NB: this does NOT work for me: zef --force-install install https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl5.git

2021-01-25
No hangs (but managing my expectations)

2021-01-22
Was looking for a 2-days-in-a-row streak...  and got it.

2021-01-21
Nothing hung!

2021-01-20
One task hung today:
Archimedean_spiral (Image::PNG::Portable)

2021-01-19
At least one hung-up process, can't remember which...

2021-01-18
Tasks that hung today:
JASON (JSON::Tiny)
Rosetta_Code_Rank_languages_by_popularity-1 (JSON::Tiny)
War_card_game (Terminal::ANSI)

2021-01-17
Deprecate .EVAL as doesn't force you to be up-front about the MONKEY business.

2021-01-16
After days with no problems, these hung:
F/Fibonacci_matrix-exponentiation
H/Hostname

2021-01-06
Chebyshev_coefficients (no modules?) ended up with 2 processes running/hung.

2021-01-05
Tree_datastructures (YAML) hung today.

2021-01-04
Find_URI_in_text (IETF::RFC_Grammar::URI) hung today.

2020-12-28
Even more random results change.

2020-12-21
Those two Math::Matrix tasks worked when run by hand after clearing out zombie precompilation processes.

2020-12-20
Tasks using Math::Matrix hung (because why?):
M/Multidimensional_Newton-Raphson_method
F/Fibonacci_matrix-exponentiation

2020-12-19
Hard-linked 'Tau-function' and 3 related tasks

2020-12-15
Maybe the bugs will fix themselves if I wait? Not too likely, but shelve until 2021 perhaps...

2020-12-13
Grand total of 1 (one, aka single, solitary, lone) more task works in the new JVM.

2020-12-12
Trying to build new JVM (it's been over a year).
Build hung, did kill -9, got:  make: *** [j-install-post] Error 143
JVM self-test did not go so well.  But it runs:
    Welcome to Rakudo(tm) v2020.11.
    Implementing the Raku(tm) programming language v6.d.
    Built on JVM.

2020-12-11
Why, why, why? So many 'fixed' tasks now bad again, random values shifted once more.

2020-12-10
hash issues cleared up (and 'srand' to the extent possible).

2020-12-09
Simplest 'srand' tests no longer failing (since when?) but more intensive code still unstable (e.g. Forest_fire).

2020-12-08
If only I had procrastinated a little longer.  Pasting in new 'random' results again, apropos of hash code updates.

2020-12-07
I have no mouth but I must scream...

2020-12-06
Tasks still failing when run from cron, as opposed to just detached from terminal?
100_prisoners
Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm
Monte_Carlo_methods
Simulated_annealing
Statistics_Basic
Two_bullet_roulette
Unbias_a_random_generator
Verify_distribution_uniformity_Naive
Word_search

2020-12-05
Fixing tasks that just need new 'random' results, classifying the remaining into groups depending on if/how 
they are affected by the srand issues.

2020-12-04
I/I_before_E_except_after_C broke recently (due to stricter coercion system?)

2020-12-03
Test of '0/24_game' was messing up, making a hash of testing stats (cf 2020-11-22) and causing down-stream issues.
Definitively fixed.

2020-12-02
FINALLY starting on revising for 'new' random output.
NB: This will not fix the 'unstable' results.

2020-12-01
The remaining tasks with that fail with 'piped' input:
B/Bulls_and_cows_Player
D/Decision_tables
G/Guess_the_number_With_feedback
M/Menu

2020-11-30
One-at-a-time had no issues today. Got more aggressive with removal of precomp files.

2020-11-29
Hung today on HTTP tasks:
H/HTTP
H/HTTPS
H/HTTPS_Client-authenticated
M/MAC_Vendor_Lookup
M/Mersenne_primes
R/Rosetta_Code_Find_unimplemented_tasks 
R/Rosetta_Code_Rank_languages_by_number_of_users 
R/Rosetta_Code_Rank_languages_by_popularity-1 
R/Rosetta_Code_Tasks_without_examples

2020-11-23
One-at-a-time worked great this time.

2020-11-22
Run one-at-a-time to avoid precomp conflicts? Yes, but tasks with 'piped' input need to be excluded:
B/Bulls_and_cows_Player
D/Decision_tables
G/Guess_the_number
G/Guess_the_number_With_feedback_player
M/Menu

2020-11-21
Tasks not completing:

R/Rosetta_Code_Tasks_without_examples

2020-11-19
All tasks finished.  This is like a trend or something...

2020-11-18
Glory be, all tasks finished.

2020-11-17
Tasks not completing: (all of these use Cairo module)
C/Colour_pinstripe_Printer
D/Draw_a_sphere-2
P/Pinstripe_Printer

2020-11-16
New failure with O/OpenGL (related to Raku changes made today? "Make coercion more specific about the source type")
No such method 'can' for invocant of type in 'Perl6::Metamodel::CoercionHOW'

Failure on compile check, but not actual run?
'Could not find ArrayHash' for A/Average_loop_length and M/Markov_chain_text_generator
(both of course also produce incorrect result, due to 'srand' change, and the former still is a flapper as well)

2020-11-15
Tasks not completing: (XML task, as before, involves precomp.)
T/Tic-tac-toe
X/XML_Validation

Nearly half the tasks that involve randomness/srand had their answers change.
(one consequence: Tic-tac-toe was hung)

2020-11-14
Tasks not completing: (none involving precomp. this time?)
B/Bilinear_interpolation
O/Object_serialization
P/Percentage_difference_between_images

'\r\n' issue fixed, so 'Strip_whitespace_from_a_string_Top_and_tail' works again.

2020-11-13
All tasks completed!

Transient error in I/Image_convolution?
Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0x7fd71ce99490, Perl interpreter: 0x7fd71da45600.

2020-11-08
Renamed some tasks, following revsions on RC by thundergnat++ 
All tasks completed!

2020-11-07
thundergnat++ rationalization of task names results in extra diffs, but no testing failures.

Tasks not completing:

'use ArrayHash' is the common element:
A/Average_loop_length: Invalid dependencies table index encountered (index 768)
M/Markov_chain_text_generator: Invalid dependencies table index encountered (index 768)
Needed to 'rm -rf lib/.precomp' (since not globally installed, just in 'lib' to get JVM to work for 'Markov')

2020-10-20
Urg, what happened with 'Law_of_cosines_-_triples-1' today?
p.s. Problem went away, a one-off?

2020-10-19
Accept that 'Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm' isn't going to magically fix itself, check for both forms of results.

2020-10-18
'List_rooted_trees' fails, should golf down the issue, seems like a new bug in Raku.
p.s. This first began a few days back, 2020-10-14

2020-10-15
Precompilation issue not getting better (esp. for *SSL modules) so clear before each run.

2020-10-13
LibXML depended on Pod::To::Markdown, which failed tests, so required force-install

2020-10-11
Upgrade to perl5.32.0: After removing all dependencies on 5.30.0, Inline::Perl5 needed install direct from git archive:
zef install https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl5.git

2020-10-09
SSL tasks seem to be OK now?

2020-10-08
Tasks requiring SSL hanging again?

2020-10-07
Some updates to hash code, a few tasks now work 100% again, others more stable (but still buggy), yet others seemingly unchanged.

2020-10-06
Cleared up XML_XPath issue, just a precomp thing.

2020-10-04
XML_XPath runs forever, never had a problem before.

2020-09-29
New Windows build of 2020.09 shows the srand bug now (but still no way to get moar-blead)
And: Why does rakubrew/build fail, when obviously the Windows version can get built?

2020-09-12
Chaos_game output changed once more. Had to do this again: 'rm -rf ~/.raku/precomp'

2020-09-11
Confirmed: MoarVM after 2020.07 doesn't build on Windows, so no 'srand' testing there until a fix happens.

2020-09-10
Stress-testing all tasks with 'srand', hoping to flush out any further instabilities...
p.s. None found

2020-09-09
Call_a_foreign-language_function hung, but otherwise no new failures related to 'srand'.
Narrowed Windows* failure to down to commit just before 2020.07 release.

2020-09-08
All thumbs with Windows*, cannot get a blead installation going, so no testing for srand bug on that platform yet.

2020-09-07
Now 'Chaos-game' output changed too?

2020-09-06
Two more tasks (Set_puzzle, Knight%27s_tour) had answers change.
Several tasks hung during testing, maybe because required modules using SSL (due to 'https' URL or otherwise)?

2020-09-04
Far harder to flush out the srand error on Linux/Ubuntu19.  Renaming my Mac 'canary'...

2020-09-03
OMG, 'srand' failures vary with time-of-day, it's a phase-of-the-moon bug!

2020-09-02
Primary issues to address:
1) varying results after X iterations (which depending on program can range from just a few 1000's to many millions)
2) interactive vs batch: stable results for each mode, but different

2020-09-01
Down to five types of tasks (some near dups) that won't give repeatable output under 'srand'.  Two more are iffy.
Oops: More failures than I expected.  Back to the drawing board...

2020-08-31
Pretty much what I feared... Not only does new hash system makes a hash of naive output testing, but many tasks using rand/pick/roll
get results re-shuffled. (applies to only Moar, not JVM)

2020-08-29
MONKEY/EVAL can be by-passed, so do. Leave explicit 'rx' alone, except when dealing with EVAL.

2020-08-27
Finished elimination of .perl, a small thing but it irked.

2020-08-23
New release and ka-boom! Solve the following error with 'rm -rf ~/.raku/precomp'
Missing or wrong version of dependency 'gen/moar/stage2/NQPHLL.nqp'

2020-08-20
Doing 'zef upgrade' periodically/by-hand now; 'Text_to_HTML' needed an output tweak to pass testing
p.s.  2020-08-28 and again

2020-08-19
'Find_duplicate_files' was failing due to kludgy symlink'ed library issue. Probably not the last time...

2020-08-17
Lots of house-keeping completed, most significantly turned back on sync disabled at time of Perl6/Raku switch-over.

2020-08-16
Buggy debugger:
Circular module loading detected trying to precompile /Users/dhoekman/.rakudobrew/versions/moar-blead/install/share/perl6/site/sources/3E687CA5BFB386524F923BAC2F986CC3C66BD24F at /Users/dhoekman/perl5/Rosetta-Code/site#sources/3E687CA5BFB386524F923BAC2F986CC3C66BD24F (Debugger::UI::CommandLine):1

2020-08-15
Ketjap, ketchup, catch-up!

2020-07-24
Everything back to 100%, dealt with minor code deprecations, Acme::* module next?

2020-07-19
Pause smoke-testing until build system fixed.
Find/fix cases where '*.' is superfluous in '*.&foo'. 
    (short answer: bare calls OK, but not with args, in Range, with .cache, adverb'd, etc)

2020-07-18
What's up with:
    T/Text_to_HTML
    S/Secure_temporary_file

2020-07-16
Added version requirement made the issue clear.  Either of these would probably have done the trick (used 2nd):
    zef update; zef install Terminal::Boxer
    zef --force-install install Terminal::Boxer

2020-07-15
New 'Abelian' error, maybe module update needed? But all modules marked at up-to-date?
    Unexpected named argument 'cw' passed

2020-07-14
Two persistent flappers:
  Long_literals,_with_continuations (most common)
  Palindromic_dates (still shows up once in a while)

2020-06-02
Another flapper with 'unhandled Failure detected in DESTROY' (like 'Determine_if_a_string_is_numeric'):
  Long_literals,_with_continuations

2020-05-18
A new flapper? And at compile time??
p.s. 06-02 not seen again...

Error while compiling /Users/dhoekman/perl6/Rosetta-Code/L/Law_of_cosines_-_triples-2
push_o requires a concrete object (got a ThreadPoolScheduler::Queue type object instead)

2020-05-15
Most fixes were trivial, or thundergnat did them, or require language fixes...
But a bunch of flappers remain:
  Determine_if_a_string_is_numeric
  Find_largest_left_truncatable_prime_in_a_given_base
  Numerical_Integration-2
  Palindromic_dates

2020-05-13
Errors piling up, should deal with them...

2020-04-30
Abundant_odd_numbers line 32: A worker in a parallel iteration (hyper or race) ...

2020-04-22
A/Arithmetic_Rational failed why?  I don't see the error, subsequent test runs OK

2020-04-03
Same suite of tasks failing (some run, memory use grows without bounds); solved by nuking just ~/.raku/precomp/*

2020-03-25
Duly assigned as GH3750, and lizmat tagged as 'edge cases', 'weird' -- I thought that's what Raku is for ?!?

2020-03-24
The 'lazy list' issue not going away, need to work up a GH issue for it

2020-03-21
Perl6 --> Raku fixes done, except maybe for a few over-looked items

2020-03-16
vim support: remove syntastic, update vim-perl6 with vim-raku (mostly just a name change at this point?)

Fixing Perl6 --> Raku links by hand is tedious and time-consuming and blessedly far-removed from current events

2020-03-14
Only minor adjustments needed for Perl6/Raku rename; modified template to use '/usr/bin/env raku', but not globally changing old tasks

2020-03-12
General failure of precomp, tried to solve by nuking again, as below, but probably should have just waited for the code fix

2020-03-09
Procrastinated for years (OK, >= decade), but moving from tcsh (to zsh) wasn't that big a deal in the end

2020-03-05
Seattle goes viral.  Programming will resume after I finish up hoarding canned goods...

2020-03-03
Output for .gist of Set* Bag* changed for a few tasks, just cosmetics

2020-03-02
Many tasks failing, in many ways; solved by nuking both ~/.raku/precomp/* and 'moar-blead'

2020-02-27
Another run at */×; barest beginnings of the project front-page

2020-02-26
Using Telemetry/snapper to find which tasks are memory-hogs.

2020-02-25
Looks like 'rakubrew' is the little build-chain thread that you start pulling on...

2020-02-22
Windows: not as bad as it used to be (but still a slog to get stuff done)
Working towards setting up RC smoke-testing...

2020-02-21
Continued work with 'rakubrew': different failure on MacOS, Windows 10 failed due to whitespace (in my fracking account name)

2020-02-14
Testing on Ubuntu VM finally in place (well, 99% done)

2020-02-13
.pick/.roll bug fixed, but for testing must revise output on all affected programs
Since the fix was in MoarVM (MoarVM#1238) presumably this won't affect JVM results?

2020-02-12
More tool-chain fun: 'rakubrew' should not be using 'Application Support', too many issues with '3rdparty' tools

2020-02-11
As distributed App::Rakubrew won't work on older MacOS (fails at least up to 10.13, 'High Sierra') 
because of library issue (chkstk_darwin) but if built locally with 'pp' it's OK

2020-02-09
Tweaks to get Ubuntu testing to work

2020-02-06
the new libtommath is screwing up srand-locked random results

2020-02-03
Aha: stale Inline::Perl5 file in 'lib' was blocking use of 'Math::AnyNum'

2020-02-02
zef install Math::Libgsl::* needs GSL header files which 'ports' doesn't supply 
(and maybe other problems too, 2.3 vs 2.5; maybe mostly for Linux at this point?)

2020-01-29
This did not do the trick, so just copied 'Type.pm' to 'lib'.
zef --force-test --force-install install https://github.com/pierre-vigier/Perl6-Math-Matrix.git
p.s. on 2020-02-13: missing library files added in a few days ago, so problem solved 

2020-01-27
git glitch, rename Möbius_function to 'Moebius_function'

2020-01-26
How about this as a style (particularly for computation/math-heavy) code: 
    skip the sigils for scalars, but keep them for arrays and hashes

2020-01-24
Extensive munging of 'Simulated_annealing' task planned, keep notes to jusify...

2020-01-21
With regard to white/black squares in 'P/Peaceful_chess_queen_armies':
rypervenche: you can use <?{ … }> to check whether the match is an element of the set. 
chloeke:     See https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Regex_boolean_condition_check
chloeke:     my %symbol := set('!' .. '~'); say '!a~å' ~~ m:g/.<?{~$/ (elem) %symbol}>/

2020-01-20
Finally done with administrivia for JVM smoke-test, and some further task-status munging (e.g. M/Magic_square* for P6, P5)
Found 1 more task, previously failing, that became functional.

2020-01-16
Situation with JVM is fairly static: nothing broke that was working, but only 1 task that previously failed became functional.
Why?? Abelian_sandpile_model and Guess_the_number_With_feedback_player consume little CPU, are only crawling towards completion...

2020-01-15
Running JVM for the first time in a long while... (man is it slow)

2020-01-14
Math::Matrix borked, but moving soon: https://github.com/lichtkind/Raku-Math-Matrix, so wait and see...

X/XML_Validation works again, installation of module was *very* slow, and reported:
[LibXML] # Running libxml2 version: 2.09.02 (module 0.2.7)
[LibXML] # ***NOTE was configured against libxml2 version 2.9.10 ***

Fails to install, but no consequences: 
    IO::Socket::Async::SSL:ver<0.7.5>  (used only by 'Cro:HTTP'/URL_shortener, which isn't being smoke-tested)
    DBIish (maybe drop from Zef-install-all, as it causes a long hang?)

2020-01-13
Can't use perl6-debug-m, 'Circular module loading detected trying to precompile', trying new rakudobrew/raku

2020-01-12
Looking at output from 'rc-parse-dump', but not as much detailed info. as AST gives

2020-01-11
AlexDaniel swears by: https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github

2020-01-10
fgrep 'call &infix:<*>' ast/* | word | uniq | less
'×' to-do: (all done!)

2020-01-09
'A' was very math-heavy, but no show-stoppers came up.

2020-01-08
'*' in Raku code stands for a lot of things that are not multiplication, so why overload it, use '×' instead?
Trying this in [0-9A]/*. Not riding this hobby-horse all the way to RC though, except for any new code added.

2020-01-06
Oops, yesterday's fiddle messed up several tasks for JVM testing.  Using .1 kludge for these now.

2020-01-05
Rakufy: .perl -> .raku (when should be this be done on RC?)

2020-01-04
Trivial but annoying: fixed 'blank' lines to become true paragraphs

2020-01-03
X/XML_Validation now has errors? Skip for now.

2019-12-17
MoarVM panic: Internal error: invalid thread ID 36905824 in GC work pass

2019-12-15
perl6 -c U/Unprimeable_numbers gave: MoarVM panic: Internal error: invalid thread ID 81405 in GC work pass

2019-12-14
Can change classify --> categorize, but not always the reverse? (e.g. see S/Sexy_primes vs K/Kosaraju)

2019-12-12
"Got it in my head that {$scalar}s would not interpolate into quoted strings, but not {1==1} except for disambiguation or code execution."

2019-12-09
Hate linked lists, skipping those tasks for now.

2019-11-24
With some recent tasks, esp. 'Names_to_numbers', starting to see the benefits of the Raku regex design.
Next stop: grammars.

2019-11-14
Right, that was a learning experience: 'm:nth' is work-alike for P5-style 'global' matching in a 'while' loop
(see: F/Functional_coverage_tree-1, P/Peaceful_chess_queen_armies).  Turns out, you can learn a lot when you RTFM...

2019-11-10
Will rally to the butterfly flag, port some P5 to Raku...

2019-11-02
Those timing tests on Top-swops: revealed that P6 concurrency developed a bug versus old Mac OS X in early 2018.
Not present in Linux, and probably not in recent MacOS releases.

2019-10-25
Contents of 'lib' is just-enough-module-code to gets JVM tasks running. May well be incomplete or out of date...

2019-10-24
JVM can be fast! Comparable to P5/ntheory for some of the prime-manipulation tasks

2019-10-22
Now I remember why I stopped testing JVM... 
After doing 'make install', edit both <jvm-master/install/bin/{perl6-j,perl}>, need to remove dozens of spurious 
instances of <${NQP_HOME}> on the line defining NQP_JARS, do: s/..NQP_HOME//g

2019-10-20
Back to JVM testing as well.
Using JDK 13: must remove '-noverify' option to 'java' (or see a future-proofing warning repeatedly)

2019-10-18
Linux smoke-testing 99% finished

2019-10-15
header for Raku on RC language comparison page?
! {{anchor|Raku|[[Raku]]}} ({{anchor|Raku|[[formerly&nbsp;Perl&nbsp;6]]}})

2019-10-14
Put off .js testing, but got serious about smoke-testing on Linux

2019-10-13
Tomorrow: Perl 6 --> Raku 
One small lexicographical shift for a language, one giant logistical PITA for mankind!

2019-10-03
Looking at adding Rakudo.js to testing system.
(that segfault seems to have solved itself with MoarVM update)

2019-09-23
Trying to track down segfault in 'P/Palindromic_dates', slow going... Only small % of runs crash

2019-09-22
simplify all instances <join('')> construction, and <join '', blah>
Does it count if ':from<Perl5>' does 99% of the job?  I think not.
mark more tasks as 'ignored' (in 'rc-task-status')

2019-09-19
Yes, 'P/Palindromic_dates', with annotations for Oscar

2019-09-11
Palindromic dates?

2019-09-09
When upgrading Perl, check up on Inline::P5 as part of the process

2019-09-08
When something like this comes up: 'rm -rf ~/.perl6/precomp'
Missing or wrong version of dependency 'src/Perl6/World.nqp'

2019-08-25
Summer break over, back-filling stuff I've missed

2019-07-30
Hey, haven't any Out-of-sync/braid errors in a long time.

2019-05-16
Cleaned out all instances of [min] and [max], and alliteratively annotated on RC

2019-05-15
Lots of failed programs due to b9f899541b3f153ea73, needed to remove ~/.perl6/precomp

2019-04-29
DNS_query generated a transient error? (not the Out-of-sync/braid one):
    Type check failed in binding to parameter '$bufsize'; expected Cool but got Any (Any)

2019-04-27
And the continued-fraction variant stunned the assembled masses into utter silence...

2019-04-25
Ramanujan finally on RC (to universal acclaim)

2019-04-24
Updated modules (now that outage is over) and fixed two resulting regressions 

2019-04-20
thundergnat++ provides huge efficiency gains for Ramanujan (and found tpyo)

2019-04-19
Re-use code, re-use bugs...  But "Ramanujan's constant" draft in decent shape now.

2019-04-17
D'oh! Was not on HEAD, so not seeing GH2788/GH2805 fixes. Keep on eye on build version!

2019-04-16
For the '--target=' problem, opened issue, GH2843

2019-04-14
In a few instances, the use of .= to dispatch a mutating method must not be white-space separated from args, why?
100_doors
Loops_Foreach
Password_generator

2019-04-12
"perl6 --target=ast" hangs for these (tries to generate entirety of large/infinite 'constant' value?)
Bernoulli_numbers
Catalan_numbers_Pascal%27s_triangle
Find_palindromic_numbers_in_both_binary_and_ternary_bases
Floyd%27s_triangle
Lucky_and_even_lucky_numbers
Ludic_numbers

2019-04-01
Collecting stats on the 'Out-of-sync package' problem. It's rare. Between smoke-test and code-health
checks, ~2000 runs/day of P6 code, and in March it happened < 10 times.  Also: appears random.

2019-01-09
Now that was a pretty bad bug (GH2593), not the first found via RC tasks, but the worst.

2019-01-08
Move tasks to alphabetical sub-directories. Github unhappy with too many files in one directory.

2018-12-09 
That was a bear, results worse not better. No more JVM testing for now. Is it even viable long-term?

2018-12-05
Flushing out concurrency: MacOS very sensitive, on Linux best to have low free memory. Either there's
a bug in the code or there isn't: resource starvation doesn't make them spontaneously generate.

2018-11-29
Going down the rabbit-hole with concurrency issues/testing. Mac vs Ubuntu, how to trigger, etc.

2018-10-18
'Law_of_cosines_-_triples' continues to amuse. Fix concurrency problems with atomic ops.

2018-09-06
Excited to add task (Law_of_cosines_-_triples) with nested 'X' operators... But thundergnat++ shoots 
it down, as hugely inefficient (sad but true).  

2018-05-22 
Busy day, 1267 commits... Less here than meets the eye, these are merge commits generated by 
'git-smoker-faker' (see in 'bin') to correctly place by date all previous RC updates (as documented 
in my custom headers, which I was pretty religous about).

2018-01-18
Hash-randomization upgrade requires some fixes (more in testing than in code).

2018-01-01
Think most of the GLR bugs are now gone? Continue and attain 100% coverage?  Sure, why not.

2017-08-13
'Random' results flip and flip again? Hope this stops soon, tests go south each time.

2015-10-11
Fixed HTTP task. Little did I know what this would lead to...
