=head1 NAME

rc-capture - capture command-line, stdout and stderr

=head1 SYNOPSIS

rc-capture B<command> [ B<args> ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Captures the command-line, stdout and stderr, then present them on STDOUT,
in that order.  The three sections of output are marked with the lines:

        ::CMD:: ::STDOUT:: ::STDERR::

If the 'command' being executed needs to redirect it's own STDOUT
you must quote the entire command string:

        Capture 'find / -type l -print > all_links'

Note that appending (B<E<gt>E<gt>>) with STDOUT will not work.
