## 2021-03-01 another run at 'srand' issues, what fun...

# On March 1st/2nd, fixed the output so all tests would pass.
#
# The problems with 'srand' that would be nice to fix: (ordered by # of tasks affected)
#
#  122 global changes that make all tasks containing rand/pick/roll change 
#        Rare, maybe necessary, but an extra-big headache when it happens.
#
#  ~50 potentially unstable, output varies from 'previous-day' builds of Raku
#        2021-03-03  0 failed (with v2021.02.1-27-g22ea9d903)
#        2021-03-04  0 failed
#        2021-03-04  1 failed
#        2021-03-05  4 failed
#        2021-03-06 44 failed
#        2021-03-07 45 failed (Mandelbrot-2 intermittant?)
#        2021-03-08 46 failed (Julia_set/Jump_anywhere/Mandelbrot-2: intermittent failures?)
#        2021-03-10 46 failed (100_prisoners output now differs batch/terminal)
#        2021-03-29 47 failed (Rock-paper-scissors)
#        2021-03-30 48 failed (Set_puzzle)

#        2021-04-14 58 failed (Constrained_random_points_on_a_circle)
#
#    9 varying results, batch vs terminal [stats for terminal]
#        2021-03-03  0 failed
#        2021-03-04  0 failed

#        2021-03-31  7 failed
#        2021-04-01  8 failed
#
#    8 never-stable/flappers (continuously differ from run to run within a given build)
#
#    ? varying results between OS/hardware ?
#      Differences even with-in same OS
#      BUT... 
#      One OS (El Capitan) on two hosts yields two different results (Brownian_tree: constant vs never-the-same)
#        [but not tested on exact same release...]
#      While an independent OS (Ubuntu 19) gives never-the-same results for same task
#
# NB: Mandelbrot_set-2 has no 'srand', still varies sometimes (basically works, just tiny differences)

# 2021-05-10
# give up for now, results not changing and not behaving when launched via cron
#exit
