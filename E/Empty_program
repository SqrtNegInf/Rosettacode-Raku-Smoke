# The empty program is valid and does nothing but return a successful exit code:

# It is also possible to just specify that the program is written in Raku:
use v6; # deprecated now

# or, even just
v6;

v6.z; # but no error?

#or even: #DH no longer!
#6;

say 'ok 1'; # if we get here, and no STDERR show up, then success
