#You've been given a contract from a three letter abbreviation government agency. They want a program to automatically redact sensitive information from documents to be released to the public. They want fine control over what gets redacted though.
Given a piece of free-form, possibly Unicode text, (assume text only, no markup or formatting codes) they want to be able to redact: whole words, (case sensitive or insensitive) or partial words, (case sensitive or insensitive). Further, they want the option to "overkill" redact a partial word. Overkill redact means if the word contains the redact target, even if is only part of the word, redact the entire word.
For our purposes, a "word" here, means: a character group, separated by white-space and possibly punctuation; not necessarily strictly alphabetic characters. To "redact" a word or partial word, replace each character in the redaction target with a capital letter 'X'. There should be the same number of graphemes in the final redacted word as there were in the non-redacted word.

Task
Write a procedure to "redact" a given piece of text. Your procedure should take the text (or a link to it), the redaction target (or a link to it) and the redaction options. It need not be a single routine, as long as there is some way to programmatically select which operation will be performed. It may be invoked from a command line or as an internal routine, but it should be separately invokable, not just a hard coded block.
The given strings are enclosed in square brackets to denote them. The brackets should not be counted as part of the strings.
Using the test string: [Tom? Toms bottom tomato is in his stomach while playing the "Tom-tom" brand tom-toms. That's so tom.']
Show the redacted sentence for each of the redaction target strings [Tom] & [tom] using the following options:

 Whole word
 Whole word, Case insensitive
 Partial word
 Partial word, Case insensitive
 Partial word, Overkill
 Partial word, Case insensitive, Overkill
Note that some combinations don't, or at least, shouldn't really differ from less specific combination. E.G. "Whole word, Overkill" should be theoretically be exactly the same as "Whole word".
Extra kudos for not including adjoining punctuation during "Overkill" redaction.
Extra kudos if the redaction target can contain non-letter characters.
The demo strings use the abbreviations w/p for whole/partial word, i/s for case insensitive/sensitive, n/o for normal/overkill. You are not required to use those, or any abbreviation. They are just for display, though may be useful to show what operation you are intending to perform.
Ideal expected output (adjoining punctuation untouched):

   Redact 'Tom':
   [w|s|n] XXX? Toms bottom tomato is in his stomach while playing the "Tom-tom" brand tom-toms. That's so tom.
   [w|i|n] XXX? Toms bottom tomato is in his stomach while playing the "Tom-tom" brand tom-toms. That's so XXX.
   [p|s|n] XXX? XXXs bottom tomato is in his stomach while playing the "XXX-tom" brand tom-toms. That's so tom.
   [p|i|n] XXX? XXXs botXXX XXXato is in his sXXXach while playing the "XXX-XXX" brand XXX-XXXs. That's so XXX.
   [p|s|o] XXX? XXXX bottom tomato is in his stomach while playing the "XXXXXXX" brand tom-toms. That's so tom.
   [p|i|o] XXX? XXXX XXXXXX XXXXXX is in his XXXXXXX while playing the "XXXXXXX" brand XXXXXXXX. That's so XXX.

   Redact 'tom':
   [w|s|n] Tom? Toms bottom tomato is in his stomach while playing the "Tom-tom" brand tom-toms. That's so XXX.
   [w|i|n] XXX? Toms bottom tomato is in his stomach while playing the "Tom-tom" brand tom-toms. That's so XXX.
   [p|s|n] Tom? Toms botXXX XXXato is in his sXXXach while playing the "Tom-XXX" brand XXX-XXXs. That's so XXX.
   [p|i|n] XXX? XXXs botXXX XXXato is in his sXXXach while playing the "XXX-XXX" brand XXX-XXXs. That's so XXX.
   [p|s|o] Tom? Toms XXXXXX XXXXXX is in his XXXXXXX while playing the "XXXXXXX" brand XXXXXXXX. That's so XXX.
   [p|i|o] XXX? XXXX XXXXXX XXXXXX is in his XXXXXXX while playing the "XXXXXXX" brand XXXXXXXX. That's so XXX.

Stretch
Complex Unicode: Using the test string: [🧑 👨 🧔 👨‍👩‍👦] and the redaction strings: [👨] and [👨‍👩‍👦]
Show the redacted strings when using the option "Whole word" (Case sensitivity shouldn't matter.) A single grapheme should be replaced by a single 'X'.

                  🧑 👨 🧔 👨‍👩‍👦
   Redact '👨' [w] 🧑 X 🧔 👨‍👩‍👦
   Redact '👨‍👩‍👦' [w] 🧑 👨 🧔 X
