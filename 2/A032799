# Observe that, if we cache the "sum of powers of digits" calculation for every prior number,
# then (for example) 8880..8889 is just the cached value of 888,
# plus (0⁴, 1⁴, 2⁴, 3⁴, 4⁴, 5⁴, 6⁴, 7⁴, 8⁴, 9⁴).
# Since those @powers_of_last_digits are constant for all 4-digit numbers,
# they can be calculated just once per "generation".

# This finds .head(19) 7x faster than the is-Disarium() in ch-1.raku !
# However, it will run out of memory trying to find .head(20) .
