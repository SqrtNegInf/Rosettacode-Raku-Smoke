# Continuation-based execution
# Continuations in Perl 6 are currently limited to use in generators via the gather/take model:

    my @list = lazy gather for ^100 -> $i {
        if $i.is-prime {
            say "Taking prime $i";
            take $i;
        }
    }

say @list[5];

is @list[5], '13';


exit; # skip further testing 

# Notice that no further execution of the loop occurs. If we then asked for the element at index 20, we would expect to see 15 more lines of "Taking prime..." followed by the result: 73.

# Failures and exceptions
# Exceptions are fairly typical in Perl6:

    die "This is a generic, untyped exception";
# Will walk up the stack until either some `CATCH` block intercepts the specific exception type or we exit the program.
# But if a failure should be recoverable (e.g. execution might reasonably continue along another path) a failure is often the right choice. The fail operator is like "return", but the returned value will only be valid in boolean context or for testing definedness. Any other operation will produce the original exception with the original exception's execution context (e.g. traceback) along with the current context.

    sub foo() { fail "oops" }
    my $failure = foo;
    say "Called foo";
    say "foo not true" unless $failure;
    say "foo not defined" unless $failure.defined;
    say "incremented foo" if $failure++; # exception

#`{
 Called foo
 foo not true
 foo not defined
 oops
   in sub foo at fail.p6 line 1
   in block <unit> at fail.p6 line 2
 Actually thrown at:
   in any  at gen/moar/m-Metamodel.nqp line 3090
   in block <unit> at fail.p6 line 6
}

# However, an exception can `.resume` in order to jump back to the failure point (this is why the stack is not unwound until after exception handling).

  sub foo1($i) {
      if $i == 0 {
          die "Are you sure you want /0?";
      }
      say "Dividing by $i";
      1/$i.Num + 0; # Fighting hard to make this fail
  }

  for ^10 -> $n {
      say "1/$n = " ~ foo1($n);
  }

  CATCH {
      when ~$_ ~~ m:s/Are you sure/ { .resume; #`(yes, I'm sure) }
  }

#`{
This code raises an exception on a zero input, but then resumes execution, divides be zero and then raises a divide by zero exception which is not caught:

 Dividing by 0
 Attempt to divide 1 by zero using /
   in sub foo at fail.p6 line 6
   in block <unit> at fail.p6 line 10

 Actually thrown at:
