This program is written mostly in the "sigilless" style for several
reasons. First, sigils tend to imply variables, and these sigilless symbols
are not variables, but readonly bindings to values that are calculated only
once, so leaving off the sigil emphasizes the fact that they are not
variables, but merely named intermediate results.  Second, it looks more
like the original mathematical formulas to do it this way (which is also
why we define a postfix:<²> for squaring values).  Third, together with the
use of Unicode, we are emphasizing the social contract between the writer
and the reader, which has a clause in it that indicates code is read much
more often than it is written, therefore the writer is obligated to undergo
vicarious suffering on behalf of the reader to make things clear. If the
reader doesn't understand, it's the writer's fault, in other words. Or in
other other words, figure out how to type those Unicode characters, even if
it's hard. And you should type them whenever it makes things clearer to the
reader.  Finally, writing in an SSA style tends to help the optimizer.
