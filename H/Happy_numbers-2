#n# OEIS:A007770 Happy numbers: numbers whose trajectory under iteration of sum of squares of digits map (see A003132) includes 1.

# Here's another approach that uses a different set of tricks including lazy lists, gather/take, repeat-until, and the cross metaoperator X.

my @happy = lazy gather for 1..* -> $number {
    my %stopper = 1 => 1;
    my $n = $number;
    repeat until %stopper{$n}++ {
        $n = [+] $n.comb X** 2;
    }
    take $number if $n == 1;
}

say ~@happy[^8];

use Test;
is (~@happy[^8]), '1 7 10 13 19 23 28 31';
