# I've elected to do 'or something' as specified in the task instructions. Rather than just feeding a few words in to check if there are equal counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c'; instead, reads in the words_alpha.txt word list and returns the words that have equal counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c', and, (to make things a little less verbose,) have more than one of each.

my @res;

@res.push: $_ for 'ref/unixdict.txt'.IO.lines.grep({+(my \b = .comb.Bag)<a> > 1 and [==] b<a b e>}) X~ " True";

.say for @res;

my $ref = q:to/END/;
abbreviate True
END

use Test;
is @res.join("\n"), chomp $ref;
