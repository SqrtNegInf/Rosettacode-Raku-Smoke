#Raku supports roles, which are a bit like interfaces, but unlike interfaces in Java they can also contain some implementation.

role A {
    # must be filled in by the class it is composed into
    method abstract() { ... };

    # can be overridden in the class, but that's not mandatory
    method concrete() { say '# 42'; return 42; };
}

class SomeClass does A {
    method abstract() {
        say "# made concrete in class"; return 'glorp';
    }
}

use Test;
my $obj = SomeClass.new;
is $obj.abstract(), 'glorp';
is $obj.concrete(), '42';
