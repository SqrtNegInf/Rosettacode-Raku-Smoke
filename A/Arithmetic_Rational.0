#Note also that ordinary decimal literals are stored as Rats, so the following loop always stops exactly on 10 despite 0.1 not being exactly representable in floating point:

for 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 ... 2 { 
    .say;
    LAST { is 2, $_, 'terminated with "2", as intended' }
}

#The arithmetic is all done in rationals, which are converted to floating-point just before display so that people don't have to puzzle out what 53/10 means.
