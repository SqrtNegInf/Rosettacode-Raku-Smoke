# How you set the address of a variable (or any other object) is outside the purview of the Perl 6 language, but Perl 6 supports pluggable object representations, and any given representation scheme could conceivably allow an existing address to be treated as an object candidate where that makes sense. Memory-mapped structs are not unreasonable and are likely to be supported on VMs that allow it.
