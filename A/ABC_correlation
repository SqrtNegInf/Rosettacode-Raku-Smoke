#n# I've elected to do 'or something' as specified in the task instructions. Rather than just feeding a few words in to check if there are equal counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c'; instead, reads in the words_alpha.txt word list and returns the words that have equal counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c', and, (to make things a little less verbose,) have more than one of each.

my @res;

@res.push: $_ for 'ref/words.txt'.IO.lines.hyper.grep({+(my \b = .comb.Bag)<a> > 1 and [==] b<a b c>}) X~ " True";

.say for @res;

my $ref = q:to/END/;
