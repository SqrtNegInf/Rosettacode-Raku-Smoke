# This could certainly be written more concisely. Extra verbiage is included to make the process more clear.

# For all positives integers from 1 to Infinity
for 1 .. Inf -> $integer {

    # calculate the square of the integer
    my $square = $integer²;

    # print the integer and square and exit if the square modulo 1000000 is equal to 269696
    $res = $integer if $square mod 1000000 == 269696;
    say "$integer² equals $square" and last if $square mod 1000000 == 269696;
}

# Alternatively, the following just may be declarative enough to allow Babbage to understand what's going on:

say $_ if ($_²  % 1000000 == 269696) for 1..99737;

# 25264
# 99736

use Test;
is $res, 25264;
