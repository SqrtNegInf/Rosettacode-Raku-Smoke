# This could certainly be written more concisely. Extra verbiage is included to make the process more clear.

# For all positives integers from 1 to Infinity
for 1 .. Inf -> $integer {

    # calculate the square of the integer
    my $square = $integer²;

    # print the integer and square and exit if the square modulo 1000000 is equal to 269696

    say "$integer² equals $square" and last if $square mod 1000000 == 269696;

# Alternatively, the following just may be declarative enough to allow Babbage to understand what's going on:

#say $_ if ($_²  % 1000000 == 269696) for 1..99737; # magic constant, tsk

#say $_ and exit if $_²  % 1000000 == 269696 for 1..Inf;
 .say and last if $_²  % 1e6 == 269696 for ^∞;
