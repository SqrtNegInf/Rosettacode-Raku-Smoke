# In this code, a sudoku puzzle is represented as a two-dimentional
# array. The cells that are not yet solved are represented by yet
# another array of all the possible values.
#
# This implementation is not a simple brute force evaluation of all
# the options, but rather makes four extra attempts to guide the
# solution:
#
#  1) For every change in the grid, usually made by an attempt at a
#     solution, we will reduce the search space of the possible values
#     in all the other cells before going forward.
#
#  2) When a cell that is not yet resolved is the only one that can
#     hold a specific value, resolve it immediately instead of
#     performing the regular search.
#
#  3) Instead of trying from cell 1,1 and moving in sequence, this
#     implementation will start trying on the cell that is the closest
#     to being solved already.
#
#  4) Instead of trying all possible values in sequence, start with
#     the value that is the most unique. I.e.: If the options for this
#     cell are 1,4,6 and 6 is only a candidate for two of the
#     competing cells, we start with that one.
#

# keep a list with all the cells, handy for traversal
