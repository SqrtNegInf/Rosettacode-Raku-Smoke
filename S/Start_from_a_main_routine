When executed with the standard setting, Raku code always runs the mainline
code automatically, followed by the MAIN function if you have one. However,
it's possible to start up with an alternate setting that might want to
create its own event loop or MAIN. In such cases you can always capture
control at various phases with blocks that we call "phasers"
