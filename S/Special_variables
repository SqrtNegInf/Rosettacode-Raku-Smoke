#`{{
# It is probably useful to briefly explain normal variables in Perl 6 before tackling special variables.
# Variables in Perl 6 have a prefix sigil to distinguish them from named subroutines, functions, classes, and so on. There is a system of sigils to mark the fundamental structural type of the variable:

 $foo   scalar (object)
 @foo   ordered array
 %foo   unordered hash (associative array)
 &foo   code/rule/token/regex
 ::foo  package/module/class/role/subset/enum/type/grammar

# Sigils indicate overall interface, not the exact type of the bound object. Different sigils imply different minimal abilities. Ordinary sigils indicate normally scoped variables, either lexical or package scoped. Oddly scoped variables include a secondary sigil (a twigil) that indicates what kind of strange scoping the variable is subject to:
