#There is nowhere in the spec where it explicitly states that the sailors cannot equally share zero coconuts in the morning. Actually, The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences A002021 considers the cases for 1 and 2 sailors equally sharing zero coconuts in the morning to be the correct answer.
#This will test combinations of sailors and coconuts to see if they form a valid pairing. The first 6 are done using brute force, testing every combination until a valid one is found. For cases of 7 to 15 sailors, it uses a carefully crafted filter to drastically reduce the number of trials needed to find a valid case (to one, as it happens...:-) )
