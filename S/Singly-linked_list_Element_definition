With Pair[edit]
A Pair (constructed with the => operator) can be treated as a cons cell, and thus used to build a linked lists:

my $elem = 42 => $nextelem;
However, because this is not the primary purpose of the Pair type, it suffers from the following limitations:

 The naming of Pair's accessor methods is not idiomatic for this use case (.key for the cell's value, and .value for the link to the next cell).
 A Pair (unlike an Array) does not automatically wrap its keys/values in item containers &#8211; so each cell of the list will be immutable once created, making element insertion/deletion impossible (except inserting at the front).
 It provides no built-in convenience methods for iterating/modifying/transforming such a list.
With custom type[edit]
For more flexibility, one would create a custom type:
}}

class Cell {
    has      $.value is rw;
    has Cell $.next  is rw;

    # ...convenience methods here...
}

sub cons ($value, $next) { Cell.new(:$value, :$next) }

say my $result = (cons 10, (cons 20, (cons 30, Nil))).gist;

my $ref = q:to/END/;
Cell.new(value => 10, next => Cell.new(value => 20, next => Cell.new(value => 30, next => Cell)))
END

use Test;
is $result, chomp $ref;
