# Raku still has the stack functions from Perl 5, but now they also can be accessed by object notation:

my @stack;          # just a array
my $elem = 42;      # a scalar value
@stack.push($elem); # add $elem to the end of @stack
say my $t1 = @stack.pop; # get the last element back
say my $t2 = @stack.elems == 0;  # true, because the stack is empty
say my $t3 = not @stack;         # also true because @stack is false

use Test;
is ($t1, $t2, $t3), '42 True True';
