#In Raku, classes that implement the Numeric role have a method called narrow which returns an object with the same value but with the most appropriate type. So we can just test the type of that object.

for pi, 1e5, 1+0i {
    say "$_ is{" NOT" if .narrow!~~ Int} an integer.";
}

use Test;
is pi.narrow!~~ Int, True, 'pi';
is 1e5.narrow ~~ Int, True, '1e5';
is (1+0i).narrow ~~ Int, True, '1+0i';
