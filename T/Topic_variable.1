# As in previous versions of Perl, in Raku the topic variable is $_. In addition to a direct affectation, it can also be set with the 'given' keyword. A method can be called from it with an implicit call:

my @res;

given 3 {
    .say for $_**2, .sqrt;
    @res.push: $_**2;
    @res.push: .sqrt.fmt('%.14f');
}

my $ref = qq:to/END/;

END

use Test;
is @res.join("\n"), chomp $ref;

# The scope of the $_ variable is always lexical in Raku, though a function can access its caller's topic if it asks for it specially via CALLER::<$_>.
