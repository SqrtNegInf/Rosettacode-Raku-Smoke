#If you don't want to execute it in shell (and you probably don't), then use this:

#say run($command, $arg1, $arg2, :out).out.slurp-rest;

#Unfortunately, it is very long to type, but that is the only way to pass your variables as arguments safely.

#You might be tempted to start using shell when you have to pipe something, but even in that case there is no need to do so. See this code:

my $p1 = run 'echo', 'Hello, world', :out;
my $p2 = run 'cat', '-n', :in($p1.out), :out;
say my $result = $p2.out.slurp;

#See docs for more info.

#If you really want to run something in shell and you understand potential security problems, then you can use qx// (interpolates environment variables) or qqx// (interpolates normally). See the docs for more info.
