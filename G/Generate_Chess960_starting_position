# We can also pregenerate the list of 960 positions, though the method we use below is a bit wasteful, since it
# generates 40320 candidates only to throw most of them away. This is essentially the same filtering algorithm
# but written in the form of a list comprehension rather than nested map and grep. (The list comprehension is actually faster currently.) Note that the constant is calculated at compile time, because, well, it's a constant. Just a big fancy one.

If you run this you'll see that most of the time is spent in compilation, so in the case of separate precompilation the table of 960 entries merely needs to be deserialized back into memory. Picking from those entries guarantees uniform distribution over all possible boards.
