#via User-defined Postfix Operator

#[×] is a reduction operator that multiplies all the following values together. Note that we don't need to start at 1, since the degenerate case of [×]() correctly returns 1, and multiplying by 1 to start off with is silly in any case.

sub postfix:<!> ( UInt:D $n ) is looser(&prefix:<->) { [×] 2..$n }
say 5!;

#via Memoized Constant Sequence

#This approach is much more efficient for repeated use, since it automatically caches. [\×] is the so-called triangular version of [×]. It returns the intermediate results as a list. Note that Perl 6 allows you to define constants lazily, which is rather helpful when your constant is of infinite size...

constant fact = 1, |[\×] 1..*;
say fact[5];

use Test;
is (5!), 120, 'postfix op';
is fact[5], 120, 'lazy list';
