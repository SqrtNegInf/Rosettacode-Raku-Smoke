See this table:

    http://perlcabal.org/syn/S03.html#Operator_precedence

for a list of the precedence levels. Raku is an operator-rich language
(and users may define more operators at will), so instead of listing all
the operators in the table, representative operators are listed for some of
the precedence levels; see later in the same file for a more complete list
of predefined operators at each precedence level.
