# The only place that Raku  pays any attention to the case of identifiers
# is that, for certain error messages, it will guess that an identifier
# starting lowercase is probably a function name, while one starting
# uppercase is probably a type or constant name. But this case distinction is
# merely a convention not mandatory:

my $dog = 'Benjamin';
my $Dog = 'Samba';
my $DOG = 'Bernie';
say my $result1 = "The three dogs are named $dog, $Dog, and $DOG.";

constant dog = 'Benjamin';
sub Dog() { 'Samba' }
my &DOG = { 'Bernie' }
say my $result2 = "The three dogs are named {dog}, {Dog}, and {DOG}.";

my $ref = 'The three dogs are named Benjamin, Samba, and Bernie.';

use Test;
is $result1, $ref;
is $result2, $ref;
