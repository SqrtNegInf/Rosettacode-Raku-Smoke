#Both Perl 5 and Raku have good Unicode support. Note that even characters outside the BMP are considered single characters, not a surrogate pair. Here we use the character "four dragons" (with 64 strokes!) to demonstrate that.

say ord('𪚥').fmt('0x%04x');
say chr(0x2a6a5);

use Test;
is (ord('𪚥').fmt('0x%04x')), '0x2a6a5';
