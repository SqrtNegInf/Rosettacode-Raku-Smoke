# In Raku, putting square brackets around an infix operator turns it into a listop that effectively works as if the operator had been but in between all of the elements of the argument list (or in technical terms, it folds/reduces the list using that operator, while taking into account the operator's inherent associativity and identity value):


# [eq] @strings  # All equal
# [lt] @strings  # Strictly ascending

use Test;
my @s1 = <florp glorp plorp>;
my @s2 = <glorp glorp glorp>;
my @s3 = <plorp glorp blorp>;
is ([eq] @s1), 'False';
is ([eq] @s2), 'True';
is ([lt] @s1), 'True';
is ([lt] @s2), 'False';
is ([lt] @s3), 'False';
is ([gt] @s3), 'True';
