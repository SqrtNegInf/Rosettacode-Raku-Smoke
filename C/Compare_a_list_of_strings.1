# In Raku, putting square brackets around an infix operator turns it into a listop that effectively works as if the operator had been but in between all of the elements of the argument list (or in technical terms, it folds/reduces the list using that operator, while taking into account the operator's inherent associativity and identity value to Do What I Mean&#8482;):

# [eq] @strings  # All equal
# [lt] @strings  # Strictly ascending
